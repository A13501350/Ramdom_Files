Thomas Gray 托马斯·格雷 (1716-1771)，是英国新古典主义后期的重要诗人。他毕业于剑桥大学，一生的大部分时间在剑桥大学从事教学与研究工作。他的生活可谓中规中矩，捷足而又稳健。

**《墓畔挽歌》**(**_Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard_**)是其代表作。

  
他出生在伦敦的一个经纪人家庭，父亲生性粗暴，母亲长期受苦，他曾有11个兄弟姊妹，但全部夭折。母亲为供他读书长期经营女帽，他是一个孱弱、沉思而好学的孩子，1725年8岁入伊顿公学，在那里和喜爱古典文学而不喜欢运动的3人组成四人同盟，他们是首相的儿子霍勒斯·沃波尔、早熟诗人理查德·韦斯特和托马斯·艾什顿。

1734年进入剑桥大学彼得豪斯学院，开始写拉丁文诗歌，1739年由首相罗伯特·沃波尔出钱，陪同学霍勒斯·沃波尔游大陆。开始一切顺利，但1741年两人发生争吵，后格雷返回英国，1742年起定居剑桥，从事创作。同年韦斯特去世，对他刺激很大。

  

**Thomas Gray** (1716-1771) was born to a well-to-do family in London. He was educated at Eton College伊顿公学, one of the oldest public schools in England. In 1742, one year after his father's death, Gray moved to Cambridge and studied there but took no degree. He lived in Cambridge for the rest of his life, reading, teaching, and writing. At this time in Cambridge, Gray began writing English poetry and his first odes, including _**Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College**_ (1747)**《伊顿远眺》**, the first of his works to appear in print. He continued writing odes and sonnets. 

Gray was a careful scholar-poet. He started writing _**Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard**_ **《墓园挽歌》**in 1742 and completed it in 1751. He was certainly not a prolific poet. 

But being essentially a scholar, he was concerned more with his verse's quality than quantity. Gray had a vast knowledge of history, philosophy, politics, languages, and literature; he also had an avid interest in painting, architecture, and gardening. **While writing his poetry, he shaped and reshaped his lines with patience and discipline, almost unmatched by any poet in English literature**.

  

Thomas Gray's **_Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard_** **《墓园挽歌》**is **considered the best example of elegiac poetry in English literature of the eighteenth century**. 

**It is a meditation on death in a pastoral setting, a sentimental expression of melancholy and life's futility**. Gray's elegy **explores the nature of mortality and remembrance**. In a way, it also suggests the poet's view of how he wishes to be remembered. 

Gray wrote two versions of this poem about death. The first was written in 1742 after the death of his best friend, and the second around 1748 after the death of his aunt. It is helpful to understand this poem more by knowing about its author's personal life. 

Gray never married. He was a melancholy man, indolent and sluggish. He was not sociable and often was shy in the company. As a professor of history and modern languages at Cambridge, he never gave a lecture. Something heavy in his disposition dragged him away from work. 

Gray's health was always fragile, and he suffered from various psychological and physical ailments. When he died in Cambridge on July 30, 1771, Gray was buried beside his mother in the churchyard at Stoke Poges. 

In this poem, Gray writes an epitaph of his own. He says that **his life is full of sadness and depression. However, he feels proud of his knowledge. He asks the reader not to judge anyone in the graveyard**. Each soul that rests in its grave is unique in itself. Gray concludes that **we all will die and man's struggles to succeed in life are futile**. **Thus,** **death conquers all**.

Given the poem's thematic importance for understanding eighteenth-century English literature, it is presented here in full.

  

An Elegy Written In A Country Church-Yard,Simon Russell Beale

【Selected Text】

**_Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard_**

The Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,

The lowing herd1 wind slowly o'er the lea2,

The plowman homeward plods his weary way,

And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

  

Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,

And all the air a solemn stillness holds,

Save3 where the beetle wheels his droning flight,

And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;

  

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r4

The moping owl does to the moon complain

Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,

Molest her ancient solitary reign5.

  

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,

Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,

Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,

The rude6 Forefathers of the hamlet7 sleep.

  

The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,

The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,

The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,

No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.

  

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,

Or busy housewife ply her evening care:

No children run to lisp their sire's8 return,

Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.

  

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,

Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe9 has broke;

How jocund did they drive their team afield!

How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

  

Let not Ambition mock their useful toil10,

Their homely11 joys, and destiny obscure;

Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile

The short and simple annals12 of the poor.

  

The boast of heraldry13, the pomp of pow'r,

And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,

Awaits alike th' inevitable hour.

The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

  

Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,

If Memory o'er their Tomb no Trophies14 raise,

Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault15

The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

  

Can storied urn16 or animated bust

Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?

Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,

Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?

  

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid

Some heart once pregnant with17 celestial fire;

Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,

Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre18.

  

But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page19

Rich with the spoils of time20 did ne'er unroll;

Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage21,

And froze the genial current of the soul.

  

Full many a gem of purest ray serene,

The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:

Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,

And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

  

Some village-Hampden22, that with dauntless breast

The little tyrant of his fields withstood;

Some mute inglorious Milton23 here may rest,

Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood24.

  

Th'applause of list'ning senates to command,

The threats of pain and ruin to despise,

To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,

And read their history in a nation's eyes,

  

Their lot forbade25: nor circumscribed alone

Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;

Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne26,

And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,

  

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,

To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame27,

Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride

With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.

  

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,

Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;

Along the cool sequester'd vale of life

They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

  

Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect

Some frail memorial still erected nigh28,

With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,

Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

  

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse29,

The place of fame and elegy supply:

And many a holy text30 around she strews,

That teach the rustic moralist to die.

  

For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,

This pleasing anxious being31 e'er resign'd,

Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,

Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?

  

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,

Some pious drops the closing eye requires;

Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,

Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires.

  

For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead,

Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;

If chance, by lonely contemplation led,

Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

  

Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,

"Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn

Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,

To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

  

"There at the foot of yonder nodding beech

That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,

His listless length32 at noontide would he stretch,

And pore upon33 the brook that babbles by.

  

"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,

Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,

Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,

Or crazed with care34, or cross'd35 in hopeless love.

  

"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,

Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;

Another came36; nor yet beside the rill,

Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

  

"The next with dirges due in sad array

Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne.

Approach and read (for thou can'st read) the lay,

Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

  

**_The Epitaph_**

_Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth_

_A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown._

_Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,_

_And Melancholy mark'd him for her own._

_Large was his bounty__37__, and his soul sincere,_

_Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:_

_He gave to Misery all he had, a tear,_

_He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend._

_No farther seek his merits to disclose,_

_Or draw his frailties from their dread abode__38__,_

_(There they alike in trembling hope repose)_

_The bosom of his Father and his God._

"Elegy Written In A Country Church-Yard" was published in 1751. The poem once and for all established his fame as the leader of the sentimental poetry of the day, especially "**the Graveyard School.墓园派**"

His poems, as a whole, are mostly devoted to a sentimental lamentation or meditation on life, past and present.

**《墓园挽歌》**是一首有关人生短暂的沉思，他的名声也就建立在这首诗上。此诗创作长达8年之久，最初是为了哀悼他在伊顿公学读书时的好友理查德 ·韦斯特，至少诗末所附的“墓志铭”是为他而作。

但纵观全诗，其内容已经明显超越了对某个具体人物的哀思，而是通过对乡村一处墓地的描写，表达对下层默默无闻的人民的深切同情。对他们纯朴善良品质的赞扬，为他们没有机会施展天赋和才华而惋惜，同时也表现了对权贵、人间虚荣的蔑视和嘲讽，对大人物傲慢奢侈生活的谴责。

  

  

The Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,

晚钟阵阵宣告白天渐渐归于黑暗，

The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,

草甸上传来晚归牛群的低声哞哞；

The plowman homeward plods his weary way,

疲倦的农人扛犁步履沉沉往家赶，

And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

夜幕降临留给我独自天地的忧愁。

  

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,

门第富贵显要权势喧嚣穿金戴银

And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,

还有美貌和财富带来的全部荣华；

Awaits alike th' inevitable hour.

它们无非都等候最后大限的来临，

The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

一路荣光最终止于坟头黄土一把。

  

Full many a gem of purest ray serene,

浩瀚大海深处嶙峋幽暗的洞穴中，

The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:

平静地躺着多少晶莹透亮的珠宝；

Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,

多少鲜花开在阴晦低矮的灌木丛,

And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

沁人的流芳在无聊的空气中白抛。
