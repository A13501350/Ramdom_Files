**Jonathan Swift** (1667-1745) was born in Dublin after his father's death. His birth was thus stigmatized unconsciously with sadness and bitterness. **He** went to study at Kilkenny Grammar School, then at Trinity College, Dublin, obtaining his degree only by "special grace". 

He tried his hand at writing poetry but was not regarded as promising. [**John Dryden**](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247510899&idx=1&sn=75b177b9c3a4ce9a107e06a3c55c33ab&chksm=c2a096dcf5d71fcafecab52ddbdfc73d6212f20011cc883f7518e3a0b9bd7d4a73a9d2d15b2e&scene=21#wechat_redirect) was heard once commenting on Swift, "Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet." The embittered young man, however, proved a good satirist. 

In 1697 he wrote **_The Battle of the Books_****《书籍的战斗》**and **_A Tale of a Tub_****《桶的故事》**, his celebrated satire on "corruptions in religion and learning". During his repeated visits to London, Swift became acquainted with **Addison and Steele** and, unquestionably, was impressed by their articles on _**The Tatler**_《闲话报》. He then got involved in the political contention of the time and wrote a series of pamphlets attacking Whig politicians with ironies and satires. 

In 1713, he became dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. In 1726, **Swi**ft published his monument **_Gulliver's Travels_****《格列佛游记》**, **his best-known full-length satire on humanity in general**, and in part, on vicious ministers, courtiers and princes. This **relentless satire of human foolishness** became a runaway bestseller and a classic in English literature. 

Among Swift's numerous political writings, his _**A Modest Proposal**_**《一个温和的建议》**, published in 1729, stands at the top of the reading list of the students of Swift's literary legacy. 

Jonathan Swift means uniquely to English literature. [He lived through times of gigantic change in politics, religion, and learning](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247507868&idx=1&sn=7f2bd4e9386485c1603cd62ed325a042&chksm=c2a0e233f5d76b25a475ce220a1d887f75709f25e6b2bfb15aa9ae4fc12e0803572d6ecdf4aa&scene=21#wechat_redirect). On the basis of divine authority, medieval scholasticism, and Renaissance humanism raised the materialistic, mechanistic, empirical scepticism, shaped primarily by enlightenment realism. Swift seemed to **prefer the calm certainty of the old order based upon rational Christian humanism**. He saw **the acids of modernism dissolving spiritual authority and the moral values of the landed aristocracy**. In this sense, his **conspicuous misanthropic** **inclination** seems to have found an outlet in his writing.

**_Gulliver's Travels_**《格列佛游记》is **a satirical novel** narrated by Lemuel Gulliver, who travels the world and encounters a series of strange and fantastical people, cultures, and creatures. 

On his first voyage, Gulliver encounters the Lilliputians 小人国, who are miniature people. He is initially welcomed to stay in Lilliput, where he helps the little people with their state affairs but is eventually forced to escape after being accused of treason. 

Next, Gulliver sets sail on a ship called the Adventure. After ayear, he arrives at a strange land where he meets the gigantic, humanoid Brobdingnagians 大人国, who exhibit him as a sideshow attraction. Gulliver has long conversations with the king of Brobdingnag, in which he explains the government and customs of England. The king is horrified, describing the English as a "pernicious race of little odious vermin". Two years later, Guliver is rescued by an English ship and returns to England. 

On a third voyage, Gulliver's shipis attacked by pirates, who set him adrift in a canoe. Gulliver then comes to the flying city of Laputa飞岛国, the country of Balnibarbi, and the island of Glubbdubdrib. He finds a chance to return to Europe. After five months in England, Gulliver goes aboard the Adventure and sails to the Caribbean. However, his ship is captured by pirates again, who put him ashore in an unknown country, where he encounters the Yahoos, a group of filthy creatures. 

Then the Houyhnhnms慧骃国, a race of sentient horses, appear to his rescue. A Houyhnhnm takes Gulliver as his servant. However, he is forced to leave when the general assembly of the Houyhnhnms exhorts his master not to keep a creature so like a Yahoo in his household. Gulliver reluctantly returns home, where he cannot help regarding all the human beings around him, including his own family, as filthy, evil, foul-smelling Yahoos.

  

The following excerpt is from Chapter I of Part IV of Swift's Gulliver's Travels. 

In this chapter, the author tells how Gulliver encounters a herd of ugly creatures, which he later knows as the Yahoos. After five months in England, Gulliver takes command of the Adventure and sails to the Caribbean. However, his ship is captured by pirates, who put him ashore in an unknown country. There, he first encounters a herd of filthy creatures who attack him and pelt him with their excrement. Gulliver realizes with horror that the animals almost exactly resemble human beings, though they have no clothes and a wild, unkempt appearance. Notice how Gulliver describes the Yahoos in detail and how he expresses his nauseous feeling towards these human-like creatures. Then Gulliver is saved by a horse whom he later in the chapter knows as "Houyhnhnms", or "the perfection of nature", the country's ruler. When Gulliver returms home, he finds he cannot help regarding all the human beings around him, including his own family, as filthy, evil, foul-smelling Yahoos.

The Ugly Yahoos: Human-like Creatures

In this desolate condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon firm ground, where I sat down on a bank to rest myself, and consider what I had best do. When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the country, resolving to deliver myself to1 the first savages I should meet, and purchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other toys, which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages, and whereof2 I had some about me. The land was divided by long rows of trees, not regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was great plenty of grass, and several fields of oats. I walked very circumspectly3, for fear of being surprised4, or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind, or on either side. I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracts of human feet, and some of cows, but most of horses. At last I beheld several animals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees. Their shape was very singular and deformed5, which a little discomposed me, so that I lay down behind a thicket to observe them better. Some of them coming forward near the place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of distinctly marking their form. Their heads and breasts were covered with a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats, and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see their skins, which were of a brown buff colour. They had no tails, nor any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus, which, I presume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the ground, for this posture they used, as well as lying down, and often stood on their hind feet. 它们头上和胸脯上长着浓密的毛发，有卷曲的，也有细长的；还长着山羊一样的胡须，脊背上也有一长溜的毛，连四肢和脚前面的部位都是毛。不过，它们身体的其余部位倒还一览无余,这让我看清楚了它们带有棕色的淡黄色皮肤。这些动物没有尾巴,屁股上也光溜溜，只在屁眼周围长出一些毛。我想，那是大自然为了保护它们的肛门而有意种植的，因为就地而坐是它们惯常的姿势，它们当然也会躺下，有时还常常后腿支撑而直立起来。They climbed high trees as nimbly as a squirrel, for they had strong extended claws before and behind, terminating in sharp points, and hooked. They would often spring, and bound, and leap, with prodigious agility. The females were not so large as the males; they had long lank hair on their heads, but none on their faces, nor any thing more than a sort of down6 on the rest of their bodies, except about the anus and pudenda. The dugs hung between their forefeet, and often reached almost to the ground as they walked. The hair of both sexes was of several colours, brown, red, black, and yellow. Upon the whole, I never beheld, in all my travels, so disagreeable an animal, or one against which I naturally conceived so strong an antipathy. So that, thinking I had seen enough, full of contempt and aversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct me to the cabin of some Indian. I had not got far, when I met one of these creaturesfull in my way7, and coming up directly to me. The ugly monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways8, every feature of his visage, and stared, as at an object he had never seen before; then approaching nearer, lifted up his fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or mischief9 I could not tell; but I drew my hanger10, and gave him a good blow with the flat side of it, for I durst not strike with the edge, fearing the inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know that I had killed or maimed any of their cattle. When the beast felt the smart11, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty came flocking about me from the next field, howling and making odious12 faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it, kept them off by waving my hanger. Several of this cursed brood, getting hold of the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence13 they began to discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled14 with the filth, which fell about me on every side.

[As a whole, the book is one of the most effective and devastating criticisms and satires of all aspects in the then English and European life—socially, politically, religiously, philosophically, scientifically and morally. Its social significance is great and its exploration into human nature profound.](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247489448&idx=1&sn=de9272506a7f301eace23402f0675529&chksm=c2a32a07f5d4a31131ce140db3f1b7e9d04745aabae41c965a57d84395ec20d9266b20fd596b&scene=21#wechat_redirect)

我在这荒凉的境地朝前走着，一会儿倒也走上了坚实的土地。我在一处堤上坐下来歇歇气，考虑我最好该怎么办。稍稍缓过劲来之后，我就进入了这个国家，决定一碰上什么野人就投降，用些手镯、玻璃戒指以及别的玩具向他们讨买一条性命；这些玩意儿当海员的在那样的航海途中总要带着，而我倒也带了几件在身上。这儿的土地被一长排一长排的树木相隔着；树并非人工种植，天然地长在那儿，没有什么规则。到处是野草，还有几块燕麦田。我十分小心地走着，生怕受到突然袭击，或者突然有一枝箭从身后或两边飞来将我射死。我走上了一条由人踩出来的小路，看见上面有不少人的脚印，还有一些是牛蹄印，不过多数是马蹄印。最后我在一块地里看到了几只动物，还有一两只同类的在树上坐着。它们的形状非常奇特、丑陋，让我感觉到几分不安，所以我就在一处灌木丛后面躺下来把它们看个仔细。其中有几只往前一直走到了我躺着的地方，这使我有机会把它们的样子看得清清楚楚。它们的头部和胸脯都覆盖着一层厚厚的毛发，有些鬈曲，有些挺直。它们长着山羊一样的胡子，脊背上和腿脚的前面部分都长着长长的一道毛，不过身上其他地方就光光的了，所以我倒能看到它们那浅褐色的皮肤。它们没有尾巴，臀部除了肛门周围以外也都没有毛，我想那是大自然因为它们要坐在地上，才让它们在那儿长些毛以保护肛门的吧。这种坐姿它们常常采用，有时也躺下，还经常性地用后腿站立。它们爬起高树来像松鼠一样敏捷，因为它们的前后脚都长着尖利如钩的长爪。它们时常蹦蹦跳跳，窜来窜去，行动极其灵活。母的没有公的那么大，头上长着长而直的毛发，除了肛门和阴部的周围，身上其他地方就都只有一层茸毛。乳房吊在两条前腿的中间，走路时几乎常常要碰到地面。公兽和母兽的毛发都有褐、红、黑、黄等几种不同的颜色。总之，在我历次的旅行中，我还从未见到过这么让我不舒服的动物，也从来没有一种动物天然地就叫我感到这般厌恶。我想我已经看够了，心中充满了轻蔑和厌恶，就站起身来走到了原先那条人行道上，希望顺着路走去最终能找到一间印第安人的小屋。我还没走多远，就碰上了一只这样的动物实实地挡在路上，并且直冲着我走来。那丑八怪见到我，就做出种种鬼脸，两眼死盯着我，就像看一件它从未见过的东西。接着它走过来靠我更近了，不知是出于好奇还是想伤害我，一下抬起了前爪。我拔出腰刀，用刀背猛击了它一下；我不敢用锋刃的一面砍它，怕当地居民要是知道我砍死或砍伤了他们的牲口会被激怒。那畜生吃了这一记就往后退去，一面狂吼起来；这一下马上就有至少四十头这样的怪兽从邻近的地里跑过来将我团团围住，它们又是嗥又是扮鬼脸。我跑到一棵树干底下，背靠着树，一面挥舞着腰刀不让它们靠近我身。有几只该死的畜生抓住了我身后的树枝蹿到了树上，从那儿开始往我的头上拉屎。我把身子紧贴在树干上，总算躲了过去，但差点儿被从四周落下来的粪便的臭气闷死。
