**Daniel Defoe** (1660-1731) was born to a butcher's family. His formal education was slim for ideological and religious reasons. At the age of 23, he had grown into an established merchant. He was fond of travelling throughout his life and travelled extensively through Europe. At the same time, the young merchant explored his talent in writing. He wrote a series of dissident pamphlets and poems. For these, he was fined, imprisoned and pilloried. 

Defoe was an extraordinarily versatile and prolific writer. He produced some 250 books, pamphlets, and journals in his lifetime. But only when Defoe was about 60 had he been known as a great novelist. 

_**Robinson Crusoe**_,**《鲁滨逊漂流记》**for which he was famous, appeared in 1719, and the _**Farther Adventures**_**《鲁滨逊漂流记的回想》**followed a few months later. The next five years saw the appearance of his most important works of fiction: _**Captain Singleton**_**《辛格顿船长》**and _**Memoirs of a Cavalier**_**《骑士回忆录》**in 1720; _**Moll Flanders**_**《摩尔·弗兰德斯》**, _**A Journal of the Plague Year**_**《大疫年日记》**_**,**_ and _**Colonel Jack**_**《杰克上校》**in 1722; _**Roxana**_**《罗克萨娜》**and _**A New Voyage round the World**_**《新环球航行**》in 1724. _**The Four Years Voyages of Capt. George Roberts**_**《乔治·罗伯茨船长的四年航行》**appeared in 1726. 

His **_A Tour through the Whole Island of Great Britain_** (1724-1726)**《大不列颠全岛记游》**is a vivid first-hand account of the country, gleaned from his many travels. Defoe is **sometimes credited as** the "**father of the English novel**", **a herald who initiated and gave momentum to the rise of the novel in the eighteenth century**. 

To put it another way, Defoe was one of **the best of the earliest writers of realistic fiction**, the genre that eventually evolved into the novel as it is known today. We must notice that all of Defoe's long major works **are fictional narratives** that pretend to be true autobiographies. 

Defoe's fiction is notable for **its seeming authenticity**, that is, the illusion of reality or truth created by using concrete details, detailed descriptions of the sources of information or ideas, simple and unadorned prose, frequent reminders to the reader to beware of inaccuracies, and, most importantly, **the first-person narrator**.

  

Crusoe, a sailor, survives a shipwreck and washes ashore on an uninhabited island. He manages to build his life alone through his unyielding spirit for survival and the provisions he brings from the wrecked ship. For twenty-eight years, he has kept a journal documenting his gardening, goat raising, hunting, grain-planting, and religious reflections. Many years after the shipwreck, Crusoe rescues a prisoner from a group of cannibalistic island natives. Crusoe names the man Friday, converts him to Christianity, and makes him a servant. Eventually, Crusoe is rescued by a British ship and returns to England. 

_**The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe**_ was Defoe's first novel, a full narrative mostly appealing to both middle-class and aristocratic readers. The novel was popular for **its combination of a believable and very human first-person narrator, realistic details, allusions and references to actual places and people, and an appealing, though somewhat unstructured narrative line**.

  

Below are two excerpts from Defoe's _**The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe**_. 

In the first one, selected from Chapter I, Crusoe recollects how his father taught him the secret of success. The successful merchant tells his son that **keeping a "middle station of life"ensures lifelong success and happiness**. This preaching typically reveals **the realistic and human-centred view of life of the middle class or bourgeoisie, which provides an irony to what Crusoe would experience in his life on the island**. It is not the doctrine of "the middle station" that helps Crusoe, an economic man of early capitalism, survive and prosper when he is stranded on a desolate and lonely island for more than twenty-eight years. However, Crusoe seems to acquire a middle-class work ethic from his father, which helps him go through the trial.

The other episode is from Chapter V. It tells how Crusoe begins to settle on the lonely island after the shipwreck. Having overcome the grief over the death of his friends and his miserable condition, he sets out to find the means to survive on the island. He swims to the wrecked ship and collects the provisions for his lonely life, showing that **he is an economic man imbued with the bourgeois ideology**. In _Capital_, Karl Marx interprets Robinson Crusoe as an example of **the pre-capitalist man producing goods because they are useful for imminent survival, not for reproduction and profit**.

_**Robinson Crusoe Preached to by His Father**_

He bade me observe1 it, and I should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes2 as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were notsubjected to so many distempers3 and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids4 of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head5, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged6 with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day's experience to know it more sensibly...就这样,这些人平平静静、顺顺当当地度过此生，最后安安心心地告别世界，一生不必遭受皮肉之苦、心智之劳，不会为了每天能够吃饱饭而像奴隶般地过活，也不会被烦心的事弄得心神不宁，坐卧不安。他们也不必面对嫉恨的情绪、悄然而至的野心和欲望。相反，他们可以在从容的生活中轻松地走过此生，有滋有味地品尝生活的甜蜜而不知苦为何物，感受自己身处幸福之中，在每一天的生活经历中愈发深深地体会到生活的幸福和美好。

**【Notes】** 

1. observe: take note of; notice 

2. vicissitudes: life's ups and downs 

3. distempers:disturbances; unrests 

4. handmaids: ready help 

5. labours of the hands or of the head: manuallabours or mental labours 

6. enraged: excited; stirred

  

他对我说，只要我认真观察，就会发现，上层社会和下层社会总是共同分享了生活的灾祸，而中间阶级灾祸最少，也不会像上下层那样荣衰不定。并且，他们的身心不会陷入形形色色的焦躁不安，像那些过着邪恶生活且挥霍无度的人，或者像那些辛苦劳动而缺衣少食的人，这都是由其生活方式自己招来的。中间阶层的生活方式有一切的美德和享受，平安和富足就如仆人一般，常伴着中产之家。节制、中庸、安宁、健康、合群，所有令人喜爱的消遣，人人渴望的乐趣，都是中产阶级可以享受到的福分。这样的生活方式，使人平静安稳地度过一生，舒舒服服。不必劳心劳力，为每天的面包发愁，沦为生活的奴隶；也不必为窘境所迫，身心都不得安顿；更没有妒火攻心，或被野心搅扰。而是在安逸的环境里，平顺地在世上度过，有滋有味地享受着生活之甜，没有一丝苦楚。他们感到幸福，随着时日的流逝，他们越发地体会到这一点。


Defoe was a very good story-teller. He had a gift for organizing minute details in such a vivid way that his stories could be both credible and fascinating. His sentences are sometimes short, crisp and plain, and  sometimes long and rambling, which leave on the reader on impression of casual narration. 他的语句时而短小干脆，朴素直白，时而又气势磅礴，泼墨如水，为读者留下了叙述自由悠闲的印象。His language is smooth, easy, colloquial and mostly vernacular. There is nothing artificial in his language: it is common English at its best. 他的措辞简朴易懂又口语化，有时甚至是俗语方言。他的语言毫无造作，完全是大众英语。

_**I Have to Do Something for Survival**_

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before. But that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This being within about a mile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on board, that at least I might save some necessary things for my use.

When I came down from my apartment1 in the tree, I looked about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind and the sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon2 geting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present subsistence3.

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship. And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if we had kept on board we had been all safe—that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company as I now was.看到此景，悲伤再次袭到心头；因为这明摆着，如果当时我们大家都坚守在船上，我们都会生还，也就是说，我们大家都会活着到达海滩，我也就不会像现在这样孤苦伶仃，没有安慰，没有同伴。 This forced tears to my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes—for the weather was hot to extremity—and took the water4. But when I came to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second time I spied5 a smal piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hung down by the fore-chains so low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope I got up into the forecastles6 of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or, rather earth, that her stern7 lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By this means all her quartere8 was free9, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see what was spoiled and what was free. And, first, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the water, and being very wel disposed to eat10, I went to the bread room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit11 me for what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.在主舱里，我也找到一些甘蔗酒，喝了一大口。这不，我正需要多喝几口提提神，来面对眼前的现实处境。而眼下，我缺的就是一只运送这许多物品的小船。我知道，这些东西都是我今后的生活不可缺少的。

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and this extremity roused my application. We had several spare yards12, and two or three large spars13 of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive away. When this was done I went down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them together at both ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light. So I went to work, and with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon another occasion.

  我醒来时，天已大亮，天气清朗，风暴止息，海洋不再如前般怒色澎湃。但是最令我惊异的是，那只在沙地里搁浅的船在夜里因涨潮而漂浮，被冲得远远的，到了我前面提到的那块岩石那里，就是我抱着它被大浪撞伤了的那块岩石。船离我所在的岸边不到一英里地，直挺挺地杵在那儿。我希望自己能登上甲板，至少可以抢救些必需品为我所用。
当我从树上的窝里爬下来，再次环顾四周时，发现的第一个东西是小艇，它被风浪掀翻了，现在躺在沙地上，就在我右手边两英里远的地方。我沿着海岸一路走去想够到它，但发现在我和它之间隔着一泓海湾，约有半英里宽。因此我又折了回来，我更想爬上大船，希望能找到一些东西满足我目前生存之所需。
午后不久，海面十分平静，浪潮远远退去，我可以走到离船约四分之一英里之处。在这里，我不禁悲从中来，因为我清清楚楚地看到，假如我们当初待在船上，便都能平安无事——就是说，我们全都可以安然上岸，我也不必为了像现在这样孤苦伶仃、孤立无援而如此悲恸。想到这点我不禁潸然泪下。但是，因为这于事无补，我便决定，只要可能，就爬上船去。因此我就扯下衣服——因为天气极其炎热——涉入水中。但当我临到船边时，困难却更大了，不知道怎样才能登上甲板。因为，船搁浅在那儿，高出水面，我伸手所及抓不到任何东西。我围着船游了两圈，第二圈时我捞到了一小截绳子，我奇怪在游第一圈时怎么没有发现它。它挂在船头，低低垂下，我费了好大的力气才抓住它，在它的帮助下我爬进了船的前舱。我发现底舱已漏，船里尽是水，但由于它搁浅在一片坚硬的沙滩或不如说陆地上，船尾翘起在沙岸上，船头低垂，几乎都浸在海水里。这样，它的后半侧便没有进水，都是干燥的。你可以想到，我的第一件事就是搜寻并查看哪些东西已受损，哪些东西还是好好的。首先，我发现船上的食物都是干的，还没有被水浸过，完全可以吃。我走进面包房，往口袋里装满了饼干，我边找别的东西边吃饼干，因为我没有时间可以浪费。我在大舱里发现了一些甘蔗酒，我喝了一大杯，我还真的需要喝多点来提提神，以直面眼前的一切。现在，我只想要一只小艇，用来运载将对我十分必要的许多东西。
呆坐在这儿盼望着够不着的东西，那是枉然的。我所处的绝境激发了我动手的念头。我们船上有几根备用的帆杠，还有两三块大木板，以及一两根多余的中桅，我决定由此着手。只要搬得动的，我都抛下船去。在把这些木头抛下船之前，我先用绳子把它们捆好，以免它们被水冲走。做完这些后，我下到船边，把它们拉向我，又把这四根木头捆在一起，两头尽可能扎紧，扎成一只木筏的样子，再在上面横放了两三块短木板，我上去走了走，还不错，但它不能够吃重，木块还是太轻了。于是我又动手，用一把木匠的锯子将一根多余的中桅一锯为三，将它们加固到木筏上。这工作颇为费劲，但我因急于要装备自己的必需品，也就干了下来，远远超出了平时我的能力。

[In _Robinson Crusoe_, Defoe traces the growth of Robinson from a naive and artless youth into a shrewd and hardened man, tempered by numerous trails in his eventful life. The realistic account of the successful struggle of Robinson single-handedly against the hostile nature forms the best part of the novel. 在这部小说中，笛福描写了鲁滨逊整个成长经历，从一个天真无邪的少年到一个精明而饱经沧桑的成年，经历了无数坎坷的磨炼。其中对鲁滨逊徒手与恶劣的大自然作斗争的描述是小说中最精彩的部分。](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247489405&idx=1&sn=357b82582d6d314a73f06dd9df6776f7&chksm=c2a32ad2f5d4a3c424ee051f7c3a5a630b4d25e2af784e29f16e8974d4ce19e0d43204cdef28&scene=21#wechat_redirect)[](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247489405&idx=1&sn=357b82582d6d314a73f06dd9df6776f7&chksm=c2a32ad2f5d4a3c424ee051f7c3a5a630b4d25e2af784e29f16e8974d4ce19e0d43204cdef28&scene=21#wechat_redirect)

[Robinson is here the real hero: **a typical 18th English middle-class man**, with a great capacity for work, inexhaustible energy, courage, patience and persistence in overcoming obstacles, instruggling against the hostile natural environment.鲁滨逊是真正的英雄：一个典型的英国十八世纪中産階級人士，极富劳动的才能，不竭的精力，还有勇气、耐心和持之以恒的毅力，这一切都在战胜困难、同自然环境作斗争中表现得淋漓尽致。](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247489405&idx=1&sn=357b82582d6d314a73f06dd9df6776f7&chksm=c2a32ad2f5d4a3c424ee051f7c3a5a630b4d25e2af784e29f16e8974d4ce19e0d43204cdef28&scene=21#wechat_redirect)

[He was also the very **prototype of the empire builder**, **the pioneer colonist**. Defoe glorifies **human labor and the Puritan fortitude**, which save Robinson from despair and are a source of pride and happiness.
