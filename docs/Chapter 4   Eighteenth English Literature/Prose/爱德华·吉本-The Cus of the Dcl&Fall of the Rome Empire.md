Edward Gibbon 爱德华·吉本 (Edward Gibbon，1737-1794年)，是近代英国杰出的历史学家，影响深远的史学名著《罗马帝国衰亡史》一书的作者，十八世纪欧洲启蒙时代史学的卓越代表，有英国启蒙时代文史学之父之称。

1737年4月27日，吉本出生于伦敦附近的普特尼镇一个富有家庭，据他追记，其家族在14世纪时开始拥有土地。到16世纪后期，其远祖已获得缙绅的称号。

父亲是国会议员，母亲共生了7个孩子，吉本为长，也是唯一的幸运者，其它几个早就夭折了，但他的童年时代也是不幸的，自幼病魔缠身，几乎接近死亡的边缘。多病的身体，加上母亲的早逝(在吉本10岁时)、父亲的严厉，他从小就磨砺了顽强不屈的意志，形成了沉默内向的性格，他由姑母抚养，年少时多病，喜欢读书**，**在《我的作品和生活回忆录》中提到自己早就发现历史是自己“特有的粮食”。

**《罗马帝国衰亡史****》**(**_The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_**)是爱德华·吉本创作的一部历史著作。全书共有六卷，分期出版。

  

Edward Gibbon (1737-1794) lives forever with his classic The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire**《罗马帝国衰亡史》**, which was published in six volumes between 1776 and 1788. He was known to the world as **a new classicist writer whose elegant and ornate prose, judicious narrative, fine irony, and a new vision of how history works impressed his readers immensely**. The work is also known for **its use of primary sources and its polemical criticism of organized religion**.

Gibbon began his life as a sickly child. His education at Westminster and at Magdalen College, Oxford, was irregular. He later recalled the "narrow, lazy and oppressive" spirit of Oxford and the "idle and unprofitable" time he had spent there. Gibbon enjoyed being alone, reading voraciously classics and engaging himself in his study of French and Latin. He studied for some time in Lausanne, Switzerland. 

In 1764 he travelled to Italy as a pilgrim for an ancient civilization. In Rome, sitting "**musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol**" under the setting sun, Gibbon was enraptured by the grandeur of what he termed "Capitoline vision" and conceived the idea of writing a history of the city, later extended to the entire Roman Empire. For the next twenty years, Gibbon devoted all his time and energy to writing this work. He never married, saying that The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was his bride. In 1783, Gibbon retired to Lausanne to complete the work; the last three volumes appeared in 1788, which made his name known to the world.

  

The following two paragraphs are from Gibbon's massive work The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire**《罗马帝国衰亡史》**. The work **is the definitive history of the Roman Empire from the end of its golden age to its final political and physical disintegration**. The comprehensive scope of Gibbon's historical view testifies to the years devoted to its composition by its scholar-author, who believed that underneath the historical progression of human events, **there must be a cause to be excavated for the benefit of the present**.

The style of the work, mostly characterized by **its urbane concerns, dramatic vividness, ornate rhetoric, and elegant syntax, has ensured its eminent place in English literature**. 

Here in this short selection, Gibbon seems to have directly pointed out some of the crucial causes—**unified but in active government, military impotence, cultural corruption, the banality of education and decay of art and learning-for the decline and fall of the age of the Roman Empire**.

The Cause of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire

It was scarcely possible that the eyes of contemporaries should discover in the public felicity the latent causes of decay and corruption. 大众歌舞升平之中，罗马人当事者迷，要让他们察觉人心堕落、社会衰败之潜在原因，几无可能。This long peace, and the uniform government of the Romans, introduced a slow and secret poison into the vitals1 of the empire. The minds of men were gradually reduced to the same level, the fire of genius was extinguished, and even the military spirit evaporated. 多年无战事的社会、单一的政体，在罗马帝国的肌体中不知不觉注入了一剂慢性毒素。人心逐渐趋于普遍的平庸，天才的创造热情已经熄灭，甚至尚武精神已荡然无存。The natives of Europe were brave and robust. Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum2 supplied the legions3 with excellent soldiers, and constituted the real strength of the monarchy. Their personal valour remained, but they no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger4, and the habit of command. They received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign, and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army. The posterity of their boldest leaders was contented with the rank of citizens and subjects5. The most aspiring spirits resorted to the court or standard of the emperors; and the deserted provinces, deprived of political strength or union, insensibly sunk into the languid indifference6 of private life.各边疆行省人心思迁，法度不统，政令不行，不觉之中，业已堕入一种人人自危、各行其是、死气沉沉的漠然状态之中。

The love of letters, almost inseparable from peace and refinement7, was fashionable among the subjects of Hadriane8 and the Antonines9, who were themselves men of learning and curiosity. It was diffused over the whole extent of their empire; the most northern tribes of Britons had acquired a taste for rhetoric; Homer as well as Virgil were transcribed and studied on the banks of the Rhine and Danube; and the most liberal rewards sought out the faintest glimmerings of literary merit. The sciences of physic and astronomy were successfully cultivated by the Greeks; the observations of Ptolemy10 and the writings of Galen11 are studied by those who have improved their discoveries and corrected their errors; but if we except the inimitable Lucian12, this age of indolence passed away without having produced a single writer of original genius, or who excelled in the arts of elegant composition. The authority of Plato and Aristotle, of Zeno and Epicurus, still reigned in the schools; and their systems, transmitted with blind deference13 from one generation of disciples to another, precluded every generous attempt to exercise the powers, or enlarge the limits, of the human mind. The beauties of the poets and orators, instead of kindling a fire like their own, inspired only cold and servile imitations: or if any ventured to deviate from those models, they deviated at the same time from good sense and propriety14. On the revival of letters, the youthful vigour of the imagination, after a long repose, national emulation, a new religion, new languages, and a new world, called forth the genius of Europe. But the provincials of Rome, trained by a uniform artificial foreign education, were engaged in a very unequal competition with those bold ancients, who, by expressing their genuine feelings in their native tongue, had already occupied every place of honour. 反观罗马，各行省接受外来教育，矫饰做作而又千篇一律。可想而知，此等教育培养的人士与那些锐意进取的古代文人相比，高下立见，不可同日而语。古代学人以本族语随心所欲的表达自己真实的思想和情感，已经占尽了学问之荣耀。The name of Poet was almost forgotten; that of Orator was usurped by the sophists15. A cloud of16 critics, of compilers, of commentators, darkened the face of learning, and the decline of genius was soon followed by the corruption of taste.

In this short selection, "the long peace, and the uniform government of the Romans" is "**a slow and secret poison**".

Gibbon seems to have directly pointed out **some of the crucial causes**—unified but in active government, military , cultural corruption, the banality of education and decay of art and learning-for the decline and fall of the age of the Roman Empire.

那个时代的人士，要想从安逸享乐的环境中，发觉潜在的衰败腐化因素，根本是不可能的事。长久以来天下太平无事，加上统一的罗马政府，慢慢给帝国注入一种毒素，使之丧失原有的活力。人们的心智逐渐降到同一水平，天才的火花熄灭，就连尚武精神也消失无遗。欧洲的土著生性勇武、体格强壮，西班牙、高卢、不列颠和伊利里亚给军团提供优秀的士兵，这才是君主体制的实际力量。他们强调个人的勇敢，要在战场奋不顾身。至于公民所应具备的大勇，是靠着拥护独立自由、重视民族荣誉、不畏强权威胁和习于领导统御等要件，经过长期培养而成，这些人完全付之阙如。罗马人只有接受君王凭一己之私所制定的法律和任命的总督，并将帝国的防卫交付佣兵手中。那些最英勇善战的指挥官，他们的子孙只汲汲于地位和阶级，把进取的精神用在宫廷和皇帝的旗帜之下。那些失去政治力量或缺乏团结合作而遭到疏离的行省，就不知不觉沉沦在毫无生气和冷漠的私利气氛之中。
哈德良和安东尼的臣民喜爱文学，这种流行的趋势与那个时代的平静和高雅的生活有密切关系。这几个皇帝本身也是孜孜不倦的饱学之士，所以整个帝国受到风气的感染，连不列颠最北边的部落人民也变得出口成章。荷马和维吉尔的作品，在莱茵河和多瑙河地区，被当地人士争相抄录，诵读不绝，就是辞意不清的二流文章也大受赞赏。希腊人在物理学和天文学上有极高的成就，托勒密的观察记录和伽伦的医学著作，都有人深入地研究，找出其中的谬误加以订正。可惜这个太平盛世，竟没有出现一位总领风骚的人物，要是不提琉善精美绝伦的诗作，真还无法超迈前贤的文采。柏拉图、亚里士多德、芝诺和伊壁鸠鲁望重士林，执文坛之牛耳。他们创建的学派被门人弟子全盘接受，逐代流传，后生小子无法冲破这无形的藩篱，只好局限心智在前人的窠臼之内。诗人和辩士的华丽词藻，无法激起熊熊的烈火，只被人们不带丝毫感情的抄袭模仿。要是有人胆敢打破成见自立门户，就被视为背离法统和正道。经过很长时期的沉寂，直到文艺复兴，民族之间的竞争带来新的宗教和语文，这个全新的世界充满青春活泼的想象力，唤醒欧洲的天才人物。就拿罗马行省的属民来说，接受外国的制式教育，不像他们的祖先使用自己的语文，可以表现出真正的情感，获得至高的荣誉，矫揉造作的意念怎么能与古人的豪迈相比？那些诗人的姓名已被人遗忘，辩士的地位为法庭的律师所占据，一大群评论家、编纂家和注释家把整个文坛搞得乌烟瘴气，天才陨灭的结果是趣味日趋低级。
