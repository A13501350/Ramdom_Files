Samuel Johnson 塞缪尔·约翰逊 (1709-1784) 英国作家、文学评论家和诗人，1709年9月7日出生于英国斯塔福德郡利奇菲尔德，父亲是书商。

他于1728年进入牛津大学，但因贫困在1731年辍学，没能拿到学位。在《英语大辞典》发表以后，牛津大学给他颁发了荣誉博士学位，因此人们称他为“约翰逊博士”。

约翰逊是英国文学史上重要的诗人、散文家、传记家和健谈家，编纂的《词典》对英语发展作出了重大贡献。和[**琼森**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247510893&idx=1&sn=a1dbcaa5a78c20d00685997f719d8c5e&scene=21#wechat_redirect)一样，他也是当时文坛的一代盟主，他对文学小说诗歌文学作品的评论，即使片言只语，也被众口宣传，当作屑金碎玉。

1737年开始为《绅士杂志》撰写文章。此后自编周刊《漫步者》(1750-1752)。

1747年，约翰逊提出编著《英文辞典》的计划，未能获得王公贵人的资助。他雇抄写手7人，经过8年多的努力，以他的博学和才智，终于在1755年编成**《英语大辞典》**(即《约翰逊字典》)。约翰逊由此文名大振，但经济依然拮据。

1764年协助雷诺兹成立文学俱乐部，参加者有詹姆斯·鲍斯韦尔、哥尔德斯密斯、伯克等人，对当时的文化发展起了推动作用。

约翰逊于1784年12月去世。

一生重要作品有长诗《伦敦》(1738)《人类欲望的虚幻》(1749)《阿比西尼亚王子》(1759)等，还编注了《莎士比亚集》(1765)，除总序外，每剧均有引言。

他是英国文学全盛时期最特立独行的批评家。

  

Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) most fully embodied the values, style, and critical concepts of the English literary culture of the eighteenth century. His life, therefore, is worth knowing in detail by any serious student of English Literature. A good book to read is James Boswell's _The Life of Samuel Johnson_, which has been considered the greatest biography produced in the English language. But for the present purpose, we present a very brief sketch of his life to shed some light on the selected reading passages. 

Samuel Johnson was a hungry reader of the classics from a very early age. He was educated at Lichfield Grammar School and Pembroke College, Oxford. But due to poverty and other difficulties, he took no degree. At the age of 28, he went to London, where he began to write essays, poems, Latin verses, and short biographies for _**The Gentleman's Magazine**_. 

In 1749, Johnson published his finest poem, **_The Vanity of Human Wishes_****《****人类欲望的虚幻》**. He then started **_his Rambler_****《漫步者》**in 1750. In two years, he wrote hundreds of essays for the periodical. His essays were essentially different from the easy-paced and personal essays of _The Spectator_ 《旁观者》(Steele). His style is **more distant, rational and impersonal, showing somehow an elitist's world view**. 

In 1755, after nine years of arduous labour with little assistance from the earned and without any patronage of the great, Johnson published his monumental _**A Dictionary of the English Language**_**《英语大辞典》**, which brought him a reputation and financial improvement. When the dictionary was published, he wrote a satirical letter to Lord Chesterfield, who turned a deaf ear to his appeal for patronage seven years before. **The letter represents virtually a declaration of independence of individual writers from the aristocratic favour and taste**. 

His small masterpiece **_The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia_** **《阿比西尼亚王子》**appeared in 1759. 

In October 1765, Johnson's last great work, the long-delayed _**The Plays of William Shakespeare**_**《莎士比亚集》**, was published. In this outstanding work of critical value, **Johnson's own comments on specific plays and his preface have been discussed for centuries by Shakespearean scholars**. The book is especially important in its rejection of the neoclassical unities of time, place, and action. 

In 1777, Johnson was invited to write brief biographies of more than 50 English poets, which were published later on as a collection with the title _**The Lives of the English Poets**_**《诗人传》**. His devaluation of **John Milton** in the collection was ever discussed by critics of the later ages. 

All in all, Samuel Johnson was the last of **the great neoclassical writers**. He stressed the "grandeur of generality" in literature rather than the particular, and **he insisted again and again that the purpose of literature is to "****teach and delight****"**. During the nineteenth century, this representative idea of his age came under attack as Romanticism displaced neoclassicism. Johnson was seen as an oddity from an earlier and less important period for more than a hundred years. Fortunately, Johnson's fiction, poetry, essays, and criticism are now read with a less prejudiced eye as readers continue to discover **the Johnsonian values of common sense, humour, and morality**.

  

Presented in the following are two excerpts from Samuel Johnson's writing.

The first one is a brief passage taken from Johnson's article published in **_The Idler_****《闲谈者》**, a series of 103 essays which were very popular among gentle-and middle-class readers of the time in London. 

Johnson wrote 91 of **_The Idler_**'s 103 essays. He is a melancholic moralist as well as a satirist in these essays. In these essays, he wants **to help his readers live a better and wiser life**, or, as he has made clear in this selection, a thinking life. Students of this passage may feel Johnson's mild satire when he says we need to lead a contemplative life instead of living like those unthinking people who "never attend either to the conduct of men, or the works of nature, but rise in the morning, look round them till night in careless stupidity, go to bed and sleep, and rise again in the morning." **We build our meaningful life with hope****, Johnson teaches us, and with hope, people will learn to think for themselves and trust their own opinions**. Interested students may also learn from Boswell's _The Life of Samuel Johnson_ that Johnson lamented for a time his indulgence in idle hours in inactivity, in useless pastimes. This passage, when read in the light of Johnson's life, may help the students understand Johnson's inclination to reasoned thoughts in a grand style of writing which would be counteracted by the Romanticist poets and writers such as [William Wordsworth](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247489759&idx=1&sn=222781fe0e8a74aaf9e9676e9b19e761&chksm=c2a32570f5d4ac66469c7c1bc327a379856483d0a2d9d6b772115dc0748a892582573ce7cace&scene=21#wechat_redirect) later in the century. 

Following this excerpt, Johnson's famous "**Letter to Lord Chesterfield**"**《致切斯特菲尔德伯爵》**is presented in full. Literarily, Johnson **is blowing off his steam with a letter**. In a very satirical tone, he lets out his pent-up discontent with Lord Chesterfield, who chose to neglect his ambitious project of making his **_A Dictionary of the English Language_**. But let's take into account the social and literary context of the time when individual writers' success was dependent on literary patronage. **This letter can be viewed in part as a "declaration of independence" of literary writing from the aristocratic patrons, hence from their values and taste**. All in all, this letter of Johnson, though short in length, became **a classic example of elegant writing**. **The satire in the letter is readily evident, but the language is a fine example of courtesy and restraint**. Lord Chesterfield, himself a writer of large number of letters to his son, is known to have displayed Johnson's letter on his table as an example of fine writing.

**_On What They Can Be Thinking?_**

When man sees o**n**e of the inferior creatures perched upon a tree, or basking in the sunshine, without any apparent endeavour or pursuit, he often asks himself, or his companion, "On what that animal can be supposed to be thinking1?"有人看见低等生物栖卧树梢，或沐浴阳光之中，无所事事，不思进取，便常常问自己，或询问同伴这么一个问题：“那生灵又能想些什么呢?”

Of this question, since neither bird nor beast can answer it, we must be content to live without the resolution. We know not how much the brutes recollect of the past, or anticipate of the future; what power they have of comparing and preferring; or whether their faculties may not rest in motionless indifference, till they are moved by the presence of their proper object2, or stimulated to act by corporal3 sensations.

I am the less inclined to these superfluous inquiries, because I have always been able to find sufficient matter for curiosity in my own species. It is useless to go far in quest of that which may be found at home; a very narrow circle of observation will supply a sufficient number of men and women, who might be asked, with equal propriety4， "On what they can be thinking?" ”何以为思？“

It is reasonable to believe, that thought, like everything else, has its causes and effects; that it must proceed from something known, done, or suffered; and must produce some action or event. Yet how great is the number of those in whose minds no source of thought has ever been opened, in whose life no consequence of thought is ever discovered; who have learned nothing upon which they can reflect; who have neither seen nor felt anything which could leave its traces on the memory; who neither foresee nor desire any change in their condition, and have therefore neither fear, hope, nor design, and yet are supposed to be thinking beings.

To every act a subject is required. He that thinks must think upon something.凡行为者皆须有行为之主旨。同理,凡思想者必有所思之物。 But tell me, ye5 that pierce deepest into nature, ye that take the widest surveys of life, inform me, kind shades of Malebranche and of Locke6, what that something can be, which excites and continues thought in maiden aunts with small fortunes; in younger brothers that live upon annuities; in traders retired from business; in soldiers absent from their regiments; or in widows that have no children?

Life is commonly considered as either active or contemplative; but surely this division, how long soever it has been received, is inadequate and fallacious. There are mortals whose life is certainly not active, for they do neither good nor evil; and whose life cannot be properly called contemplative, for they never attend either to the conduct of men, or the works of nature, but rise in the morning,生活中多有决而不行的凡夫俗子，既不行善也不作恶。这些人的生活也不可称之为深思多虑；他们既不关心人事，也不在意物律。他们每天清晨起床，一天呆头呆脑，游手好闲，及至夜幕降临，上床睡觉，第二天又日出而起。look round them till night in careless stupidity, go to bed and sleep, and rise again in the morning.

(from _**The Idler**_)

【Notes】

**1. On what that animal can be supposed to be thinking: Johnson here refers to John Locke's beginning statement in his book _An Essay Concerning Human Understanding_, "I know it is an opinion, that the soul always thinks", and then proceeds to refute that opinion.** 

**2. presence of their proper object: coming of others that catch (their) attention** 

**3. corporal: bodily; physical** 

**4. propriety: common way of speaking** 

**5. ye: (old form of) you** 

**6. kind shades of Malebranche and of Locke: kind students and supporters of great scholars such as Malebranche or of such great philosophers as John Locke. Malebranche(1638-1715)was a French Catholic priest and rationalist philosopher, well-known for his scope of learning.** **John Locke(1632-1704) was an English philosopher and physician, well-known for his in-depth study of human understanding and for his empiricist proposition in philosophy.**

**Malebranche 尼古拉·马勒伯朗士(马勒布朗士)，法国哲学家。法兰西科学院院士。他是法国天主教天主教奥拉多利修会的神甫，著名神学家和哲学家，十七世纪笛卡尔学派的代表人物。**

**John Locke 约翰·洛克是英国****哲学家****和医生，被广泛认为是最有影响力的一个启蒙思想家和俗称“****自由主义****”之父。认为是英国最早的****经验主义者****之一，按照**[**弗朗西斯·培根****爵士**](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247510854&idx=1&sn=21781841773ee2af8d2cf530d9c40617&chksm=c2a096e9f5d71fff6892b769c76a45faa68df67c0a74b6d29680d22d7a6bfb3515ed1cc39c17&scene=21#wechat_redirect)**的传统，他对****社会契约****论同样重要。他的工作极大地影响了****认识论****和****政治哲学****的发展。**

  

Johnson's "grand" style: his collaborative with each other, his sentences are long but well-balanced and easy to follow, and his tone is pontifical. e.g. the article "On What They Can Be Thinking?"be quoted in _The Idler_.

  

[Steele](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247511887&idx=1&sn=07fd0685a62fff506c1b0e3b783ea7a5&chksm=c2a092e0f5d71bf6bbbe68a1763fa9b446bc4a020448df5047d79d0edbcbbf7e117ea837a492&scene=21#wechat_redirect)'s style: It is even-paced and deliberate, using balanced clauses and carefully chosen words to make a point clear and inspiring. e.g. his article "On the Death of Friends", published inThe Tatler, 1710, is a quintessentially measured piece from the early eighteenth century.

  

Johnson's thought: to build the meaningful life with hope, and with hope, people will learn to think for themselves and trust their own opinions or their thinking.

_**Letter to Lord Chesterfield**_

My Lord,

I have been lately informed by the Proprietor of The World1 that two Papers in which my Dictionary is recommended to the Public were written by your Lordship. To be so distinguished is an honour which, being very little accustomed to favours from the Great2, I know not wellhow to receive, or in what terms3 to acknowledge.蒙受您如此眷顾，余之殊荣。然对于大人物之垂青，余从来无福消受，便茫然不知如何躬迎，亦不知如何措辞，以表谢忱。

When upon some slight encouragement I first visited your Lordship I was overpowered like the rest of Mankind4 by the enchantment of your address5, and could not for bear to wish that I might boast myself Le Vainqueur du Vainqueur de la Terres6,  that I might obtain that regard for which I saw the World contending, but I found my attendance so little encouraged, that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it. When I had once addressed your Lordship in public, I had exhausted all the art of pleasing7 which a retired and uncourtly Scholar can possess. I had done all that I could, and no Man is well pleased to have his all neglected, be it ever so little.

Seven years, My lord have now past since I waited in your outward Rooms or was repulsed from your Door, during which time I have been pushing on my work through difficulties of which it is useless to complain, and have brought it at last to the verge of Publication without one Act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a Patron before.

The Shepherd in Virgil grew at last acquainted with Love, and found him a Native of the Rocks8.

Is not a Patron, My Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a Man struggling for Life in the Water and when he has reached ground encumbers him with help.高贵之爵爷：敢问既为恩主，何以先漠然于溺水之人，视其水中挣扎而无动于衷，后见其挣扎上岸时则伸手援助，反碍其身？The notice which you have been pleased to take of my Labours, had it been early, had been kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it, till I am solitary and cannot impart it, till I am known and donot want it.您之垂顾若来得早，则为行善，若来得迟缓，则似有可无，消受不起；此时来迟，余已独行独立，无人分享，功成名就，取之何用！

I hope it is no very cynical asperity9 not to confess obligation where no benefit has been received, or to be unwilling that the Public should consider me as owing that to a Patron, which Providence has enabled me to do for myself.

Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any Favourer of Learning10 shall not be disappointed though I should conclude it, if less be possible, with less, for I have been long wakened from that Dream of hope, in which I once boasted myself with so much exultation11,

My Lord,

Your lordship's most humble

most obedient servant

SAM. JOHNSON.

【Notes】

**1. The World: a very popular magazine in London during the period from 1753 to 1756.**

**2. the Great: (ironic) people with great name and fame** 

**3. in what terms: in what words** 

**4. the rest of Mankind: all the other people in this world** 

**5. address: the mannered way of talking** 

**6. Le Vainqueur du Vainqueur de la Terre: (French) conqueror of the conqueror of the earth. This is a catchphrase from Nicolas Boileau (1636-1711); it is used here to mean literarily: "****a poet (good writer) being above the great hero who wins the whole world****".** 

**7. exhausted all the art of pleasing: used all my skill of making people happy** 

**8. The Shepherd in Virgil...Native of the Rocks: This allusion is from Virgil's poem that tells** **a lovesick shepherd's complaint against Cupid (the god of love), who is hard to be moved to love because he has grown in stony caves****. With this allusion, Johnson is saying that he has finally found Lord Chesterfield** **an uncultured man with stony heart.** **(这里暗指切斯菲尔德伯爵心如铁石冰冷坚硬。)**

**9. cynical asperity: man-hating rudeness or hard feelings** 

**10. Favourer of Learning: patron of literary activity and scholarship**

**11. exultation: great happiness**

  

Samuel Johnson, so during the last twenty years of his life he wrote as little as he decently could and enjoyed a pleasant and easy life, sort of as a literary authority, talking about and commenting on liter rature and literary men in his famous Literary Club, where he was surrounded with respect by the elite of the literary circles. As a **lexicographer**, Johnson distinguished himself as the author of the first English dictionary by an Englishman—_A Dictionary of the English Language_. Johnson's style is **typically neoclassical**, but it is at the opposite extreme from Swift's simplicty or Addison’s neatness.

塞缪尔·约翰逊，在他生命的最后二十年里，约翰逊的创作非常少，而只是享受简单的生活。在他的文学俱乐部里，他被文学界的精英们众星捧月尊为巨奖权威，点评一些文学作品与作家。作为一位词典编纂家，约翰逊编纂出史上第一部英语词典。约翰逊的写作风格有典型的新古典主义特色，但是与斯威夫特和爱迪生的简洁截然不同。

  

18世纪前的英国，出版业由皇家管理的内部组织书商公会负责管理出版业。同时，国家主要通过许可法案强化书商公会对出版业的管理。但是18世纪以来，书商公会逐渐失去在出版业管理中的优势，无力控制出版业的发展，而英国官方却逐渐承担起了对出版业的管理。

  

  

Earl of Chesterfield 菲利普·道摩·斯坦霍普，切斯特菲尔德第四任伯爵(1694-1773年)，英国政治家和文学家。因写给非婚生子菲利普·斯坦霍普(Philip Stanhope)的书信而闻名(1737-68年，1774年出版)。这些书信风格**简洁优美、充满了处事智慧、睿智的建议和犀利的评论**。“切斯特菲尔德式”(Chesterfieldian)仍然表示温文儒雅的意思。切斯特菲尔德也给他的教子写过类似的书信(1761-70年，1890年出版)，巧合的是他的教子也叫菲利普·斯坦霍普。

约翰逊是英国18世纪中叶以后的文坛领袖。1762年，国王乔治三世给了他每年300镑的津贴。1763年他遇到了他未来的传记作者詹姆士·包斯威尔。1764年，他的文友在伦敦成立文学俱乐部，聚集了文学家、戏剧表演家、画家和政界名人，定期聚会，谈文论政，影响了一代的文学趣味和文化风尚。

约翰逊是最受敬仰的人物，人们争相传诵他的妙语雄辩。首批会员中有政治家埃德蒙·伯克、小说家奥利弗·哥尔德斯密斯、画家乔舒亚·雷诺兹、名演员加里克，较后参加的有历史家爱德华·吉本(下一节介绍)、东方学家威廉·琼斯。

  

**塞缪尔·约翰逊奖**(座右铭：“All the Best Stories are True”)是最负盛名的非小说类写作奖之一。

塞缪尔·约翰逊奖以作家塞缪尔·约翰逊的名字命名，成立于1999年，取代了NCR图书奖(NCR Book Award)，资金由一位匿名人士捐赠。

该奖项奖项范围涵盖了时政历史、政治、科学、体育、旅游、传记、自传和艺术。冠军可获奖金20,000英镑。

  

【《致切斯特菲尔德伯爵》译文参考】

伯爵大人：

新近从《世界报》业主处获悉，有两篇文章是大人阁下所写，此两文把我的辞典介绍给了公众。如此出众，实是一种荣耀。因为对来自大人物的恩惠很不习惯，我真不知道如何承受这种荣耀，或以何种方式来感激。

当初，受到些许的鼓励，我首次去拜访大人时，像其他人一样，我被您谈吐的魅力所倾倒，不禁希望我可以吹嘘我自己是“世界征服者的征服者”。我的自尊与羞怯都不让我继续这种拜访。当我曾在公众面前对您致意时，我是尽我一个与事无争、不善阿谀奉承的学者所能具有的所有方式让人愉快。我已经做了我所能做到的一切，而一切努力被忽视了。哪怕是一点点的忽视，也是没有人会感到高兴的。

伯爵大人，自从我在您的外厅等候，或者说，被拒之于您的门外，已过去7年了。这7年中我含辛茹苦地进行着我的工作。现在去抱怨这些已无用。最终，我的辞典出版在即，没有一个援助之举动，没有一句鼓励之话语，没有一丝赞许之微笑。这样的待遇我未曾盼望过，因为我以前从未有过保护人。

维吉尔笔下的牧童终认识了爱神，发现他不过是个荒山野岭中的野蛮人。

伯爵大人，这样的人不应算是一个保护者吧？他看着一个人在水中争扎求生而无动于衷，可是，当那人上岸后却以援助碍事，承蒙您关注到我的劳作。如果这种关注来得早一点，那会是善意的；但它耽延了，直到我已淡漠无兴，不能消受了，直到我孤独一身，不能分享了，直到我功成名就，不需要它了。

我没有接受恩惠，就不承情。上苍使我独自完成事业，我不愿公众认为我应感激一个保护人，我希望这不是客薄寡情吧！

既已在无保护人之援的情况下把我的工作进行到这一步，我不会感到失望的，虽然我要最后完结我的工作，如果无任何可能的援助，那就在无援的情况下去完结它吧，因为我早已从那种希望之梦中清醒。伯爵大人，我曾极其兴奋地自夸我自己是您最恭谦最忠顺的仆人
