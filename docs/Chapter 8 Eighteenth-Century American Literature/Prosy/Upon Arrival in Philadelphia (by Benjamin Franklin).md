## About Benjamin Franklin

Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) is known as an American "saint" who helped shape most of the important political, social, and intellectual developments in eighteenth-century America. He became a veritable symbol of America by the end of his life, both at home and abroad, and he remains an influential folk hero. Franklin was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He learned to read when very young but had very little formal schooling, for his family could not afford to send him to college. Franklin was a self-taught man with versatile capabilities. His life was varied, and his achievements diversified. The most familiar is the successful businessman who rose from humble life to high status of political and literary success through his own efforts. His life symbolized the rags-to-riches success of a self-made man, a theme of great importance in American, thought. 

His version of his life, as presented in his instructional Autobiography (1791) and in the sayings from Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758), stressed thrift, industry, and frugality— important elements of his own Puritan heritage, rendered in secular, easily understood forms. His zest for useful knowledge became the main style of American science and technology. Yet, he had great respect for learning and intellectual curiosity and believed that educational opportunity was indispensable for a great future nation. He was civic-minded from the start. He demonstrated what could be done by the private, voluntary community effort to care for human needs, but he also stressed the importance of alert participation in the prevailing political system. 

His style was egalitarian, tolerant, and democratic before such a style was expected and common; yet he understood well the importance of dignity and deference in human affairs. During his later years, Americans repudiated kings and hereditary aristocrats, but they also yearned for heroes. Franklin provided them with a hero unlike any other known before.v! To Ur a wee elecT

Presented below is a famous excerpt from Benjamin Franklin's inspiring Autobiography.

He was spotted by Miss Read, his future wife, in his "most awkward, ridiculous appearance". 

This sketch of Franklin's life is popularly received as the starting point of a self-made man embarking on a successful pursuit of the "American Dream", which, in his time, was believed to be an ideal that all men are created equal and could be better off and successful through their hard work, courage and determination.
