## About Philip Freneau

Philip Freneau (1752-1832), known as the "poet of the American Revolution", a miscellaneous writer, editor, and journalist, was born in New York and educated at New Jersey College (later Princeton). In 1775, while in New York, Freneau wrote and published patriotic poems and essays, satirizing the British. He was arrested twice and later wrote about the British cruelty shown to him and other prisoners in "The British Prison-Ship", which he published in 1781. In 1786, Freneau's first collection of poems, The Poems of Philip Freneau: Written Chiefly during the Late War, was published. Two years later, The Miscellaneous Works of Mr Philip Freneau Containing His Essays and Additional Poems, appeared. In 1791, Freneau moved to Philadelphia with his wife to work as a part-time translator for the US government and editor of the National Gazette. When the magazine collapsed, Freneau returned to Mt. Pleasant. There he set up his own press. In 1809 and again in 1815, he supervised the printing of several collections of his poems. 

Freneau was a prolific poet and journalist. His poetry covers a variety of subjects, including the political situation, Native Americans, nature, the sea, and naval battles. His political poems are often satiric, but his nature poetry is marked by lyricism and close observation of the details of the American landscape. Freneau's work displays some of the characteristics of Romanticism-especially in its close attention to, and feeling for, nature.

## About This Selection

"The Wild Honey Suckle" is now the most frequently reprinted and quoted of Freneau's poems. The critics agree that this is the poet's best lyric and is perhaps his most accomplished verse composition. It has a serenity, a sense of awe and loss that is rare, and it combines native subject matter with the poet's philosophy of the transience of all human experiences. The poem's theme and tone are quite alien to his popularity as the "poet of the American Revolution". 


Philip Freneau（1752-1832）被赞誉为“美国革命诗人”，同时也是一位多产的散文作家、编辑和记者。他出生于纽约，在新泽西的普林斯顿大学接受教育。在1775年的纽约时期，Freneau 创作并出版了讽刺英国人的爱国诗歌和散文。他数次被抓，以其描写英国人对待战俘的残酷行径而闻名。1786年，Freneau 出版了他的第一本诗集《弗瑞诺诗选》。两年后，他的杂文集也得到了出版。1791年，Freneau 与妻子搬到费城，开始担任美国政府的翻译并担任《国家公报》的编辑工作。完成这些任务后，Freneau 返回了蒙特普莱森特，并在那里开设了自己的出版社。1809年至1815年，他监督出版了几本自己的诗集。 

Freneau 是一位涉猎广泛的诗人和记者，他的诗歌涵盖了各种主题，包括政治局势、美洲原住民、自然界、海洋以及海战。他的政治诗常常带有讽刺意味，而他的自然诗则以抒情风格和对美国景观的细致观察见长。

Freneau 的作品展现了浪漫主义特征，尤其是对自然的深切热爱和对情感的全情投入。 《野金银花》是Freneau 诗歌中被广泛重印和引用的作品之一。评论界一致认为这是诗人最杰出的抒情诗歌，可能是他最有作品的创作之一。这首诗带有一种罕见的平静、敬畏和失落感，将题材与诗人对人生短暂性的哲学思考相结合。这与他作为“美国革命诗人”的形象大相径庭。
