Phillis Wheatley (c.1753-1784) was remarkably the first African American of either sex to publish a collection of poetry in colonial America. She was born in western Africa, kidnapped by slave traders in 1761, transported in a slave ship to Boston and put up for sale. Susanna Wheatley, the wife of prosperous Boston tailor John Wheatley, picked out the child, so the slave girl took the surname of her new owners. The Wheatleys taught Phillis to read and write, which was remarkable at a time when literacy was forbidden for slaves. Phillis was soon reading the Bible, classical mythology, ancient history, geography, astronomy, and literature. When she began to compose poetry around the age of twelve, her mistress encouraged her. On December 21, 1767, the Newport Mercury published Phillis's first poem. The unusual circumstances of the young poet-her gender, age, race, and unexpected literacy - drew the attention of many notables of the day, including Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. Wheatley continued to write and publish poems for the next couple of years, most of them for special occasions and public events.

In 1773, Wheatley's Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, appeared in London and was enthusiastically received. The publication of a slave girl's poems attested to the spiritual and intellectual capacities of the black people kept in bondage. Shortly she was released from slavery. She, for the first time, wrote openly about the injustice of slavery, condemning slavery in strong terms. Her letter was published in newspapers throughout New England and was considered an important contribution to the abolitionist movement. The final days of her life were marked by deprivation and hardship. She did not live to see her final poem, a celebration of American independence, published.

## About This Selection

This is a beautiful poem collected in Phillis Wheatley's first and only poetry book, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral. The book collected thirty-nine poems, including "A Hymn to the Evening" and "A Hymn to Humanity". 

In this poem, Wheatley displays the beauty of the morning. She makes the readers aware of the fact that though nothing lasts forever, from the time a thing is born till the time it dies, it is, as a matter of fact, truly adorable. Every living being on Earth, be it a little flower or a human being, is an exclusive design of nature.

菲利斯·惠特利（约1753-1784）是美国殖民地时期第一位出版诗集的非裔美国人。她出生于西非，在1761年被奴隶贩子绑架，用奴隶船运到波士顿出售。波士顿富裕裁缝约翰·惠特利的妻子苏珊娜·惠特利挑选了这个孩子，所以这位女奴随了新主人的姓氏。惠特利夫妇教菲利斯读书写字，在奴隶被禁止识字的时代，这是了不起的。菲利斯很快开始阅读《圣经》、古典神话、古代历史、地理、天文学和文学。当她大约12岁开始创作诗歌时，她的女主人鼓励她。1767年12月21日，《纽波特水星报》发表了菲利斯的第一首诗。她的特殊境遇——性别、年龄、种族和出人意料的识字能力——吸引了许多当时的名人，包括本杰明·富兰克林和乔治·华盛顿。惠特利在接下来的几年里继续写作和出版诗歌，其中大部分是为特殊场合和公共活动而写的。 1773年，惠特利的《关于各种宗教和道德的诗歌》在伦敦出版，受到了热烈的欢迎。一个奴隶女孩的诗歌出版证明了被奴役的黑人的精神和智力能力。不久，她从奴役中被释放。她第一次公开谴责奴隶制的不公正，强烈批判奴隶制。她的信在新英格兰各地的报纸上发表，被认为是对废奴运动的重要贡献。她生命的最后几天充满了贫困和困苦。她没有活着看到她的最后一首诗——一首庆祝美国独立的诗——出版。
