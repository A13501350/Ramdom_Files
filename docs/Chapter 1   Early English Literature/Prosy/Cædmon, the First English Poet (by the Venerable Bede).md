The Venerable Bede (672/673-735) is a saintly historian and scholar in the history of English letters. When young, he studied under [Benedict Biscop](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247505079&idx=1&sn=003c537f584e54373e0f115f4bf097a8&scene=21#wechat_redirect), the abbot of Wearmouth. From there, he went in 682 to Jarrow, a holy town east of present-day Newcastle in Northern England, where he spent most of his life. 

He was a diligent teacher and scholar of Latin and Greek, and had many pupils among the monks of Wearmouth and Jarrow. He was buried at Jarrow, but his remains were moved to Durham during the first half of the eleventh century. 

Bede was first called "Venerable" during the ninth century. 

In 731, Bede completed his famous book, [Ecclesiastical History of the English People《英吉利教会史》](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247505079&idx=1&sn=003c537f584e54373e0f115f4bf097a8&chksm=c2a0e918f5d7600ea86b020c41dc9d9ddd5f96c34ab3cccebf487327489325f39f4d9a8bee3f&scene=21#wechat_redirect), by which time he had written nearly 40 works, mostly biblical commentaries. His early treatise De Natura Rerum《论事物本质》contains rudimentary natural science, referring phenomena to natural causes. His other influential history work is the Lives of the Abbots 《修道院长列传》, which gives an account of the earlier abbots in the Northumbrian Revival. 

Bede is generally considered the "father of English history". His account of the medieval English people certainly sheds light on our understanding of the beginning of English literature.

  

The following episode is from Bede's [_Ecclesiastical History of the English People_](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247505079&idx=1&sn=003c537f584e54373e0f115f4bf097a8&chksm=c2a0e918f5d7600ea86b020c41dc9d9ddd5f96c34ab3cccebf487327489325f39f4d9a8bee3f&scene=21#wechat_redirect). 

Cædmon(657-684) has traditionally been considered the first English poet from whom a poem has survived. The sole source of information on Cædmon's life is recorded in Bede's book. According to Bede, Cædmon was an illiterate herdsman, employed on a monastic landed estate near Whitby Abbey. His only known surviving work is Cædmon's Hymn《卡德蒙的赞美诗》, a nine-line alliterative vernacular头韵白话 in Old English. The poem is one of the earliest examples of Old English, earlier than **[Beowulf](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247488995&idx=1&sn=4852cd10e99c506f3011692aebc806b1&scene=21#wechat_redirect)**, an epic poem in the tradition of Germanic heroic legend composed around the ninth century. 

It must be noted that Bede devoted his life to chronicling the development of Christianity in England from Roman times to his day. All that he wrote in the book had an overriding religious intent. In this dramatic account, therefore, Cædmon's sudden capability of singing a song in praise of Christian belief in the Creation is but a matter of course. 

Although Cædmon's surviving poetic output is small, he holds an important place in literary history as the founder of English vernacular poetry白话体诗歌的创始人. His Hymn embodies the vigorous expression, style, and conventions of later Anglo-Saxon poems, with their strong metaphors隐喻, alliterative verses头韵 as an aid to memory, unrhymed verses非押韵体, half-line construction半行结构, and memorable epithets修饰词.

  

## 【Selected Text】 _Cædmon, the First English Poet*_

In this abbess's monastery was a certain brother made especially famous and honoured with a divine gift2 because he was accustomed to producing suitable poetry which pertained to religion and piety3, such that, whatever he learned from divine scriptures through scholars, he was able to transpose into poetry after a short period of time adorned4 with the most sweetness and inspiration and to produce it well, and made in the English language...

He was established in the secular life until a time when he was advanced in years, and he had never learned any poetry.此人曾为一俗人，浑浑噩墨不觉成年，亦未曾学习诗书。And he was often in drinking parties, when it was decreed, as a cause for joy, that they should all sing in turns to the accompaniment of the harp. When he saw the charp approach him, he rose up for shame from that feast and went home to his house. On a certain occasion, when he did just that, he left the building of the drinking party and went out to the animal shed, the care of which had been given to him that night. 每见竖琴趋近，便面带愧色，起而离场，径自回舍歇息。有一次，他离开酒肆闹场，来厩栏，按照主人吩咐，一夜照看牲畜。Then, in due time, he got himself settled in rest and slept5, and a man stood before him as if in a dream and called him and greeted him and spoke to him by his name: "Cædmon, sing me something," Then he answered and said: "I cannot sing; and therefore, I left the party and came here because I am not able to sing anything." Again, the one who was speaking with him said: "Nevertheless, you must sing something for me." Then Cædmon said: "What shall I sing?" He said: "Sing to me about Creation6." When he got this answer, he began to sing straightaway in praise of7 our Creator, in verse and words that he had never heard, of which the arrangemente8 is:

Now praise the Guardian of the heavenly kingdom,

the might of the Creator and his conception,

...

Then he arose from sleeping, and all that he had sung while sleeping was secure in his memory, and immediately he added many words in the same metre9 to the words of the worthy poem to the Creator. In the morning, he came to the estate's reeve who was his superior; he told him about the gift that he had received. And straightaway the reeve led him to the abbess and he informed and told her. Then she instructed that all the most learned men and students should be gathered together, and she asked Cædmon to tell them his dream and sing the poem, so that all of them who were selected might judge what the poem was and where it came from.

Jarrow(贾罗)位于英格兰的东北部。公元674年，修道院院长Biscop(比斯克普)在此建造圣保罗修道院(St. Paul's Monastery, Jarrow)和大祭坛，仍然屹立至今。比斯克普一生中去过罗马很多次，他建的公共档案馆是英国最古老的建筑之一。

贾罗因砖石建筑和彩色花窗而被人铭记，还有另一种闻名世界的艺术品，那就是手抄本（《英吉利教会史》为手抄本之一）。
Whitby Abbey(惠特比修道院)位于苏格兰北约克郡海滨小镇惠特比，也是吸血鬼之乡惠特比的地标。  

##  中文译文

在这位女修道院院长1 的修道院里，有一位兄弟因着神圣的恩赐2 而特别著名和受人尊敬，因为他习惯创作适合宗教和虔诚的诗歌3。他从学者那里通过神圣的经书学到的任何东西，他都能够在短时间内转换成诗歌，并用最甜蜜和最鼓舞人心的修饰4 来润色，用英语完美地创作出来……

他一直过着世俗的生活，直到他年事已高的时候，他从未学习过任何诗歌。此人曾为一俗人，浑浑噩噩不觉成年，亦未曾学习诗书。他经常参加喝酒的宴会，当他们为了表示高兴，决定轮流伴随着竖琴歌唱时，每当他看到竖琴向他靠近，他就羞愧地起身离开宴会回家休息。有一次，他这样做之后，就离开了喝酒的地方，去了牲畜棚，因为他那天晚上被主人分配去照看牲畜。

然后，到了适当的时候，他躺下休息并睡着了5。这时，仿佛在梦中，一个人站在他面前，叫他，问候他，并叫他的名字说：“坎道尔，唱点什么给我吧。”他回答说：“我不会唱歌，所以我离开了宴会来到这里，因为我不会唱任何东西。” 然而，那个和他说话的人又说：“你仍然必须为我唱点什么。” 坎道尔说：“我该唱什么？” 他说：“为我唱一首关于创造的故事6。”得到了这个回答后，他立刻开始用诗歌和从未听过的语言赞美7 我们的造物主，这些语言的排列是这样的8：

现在歌颂天国守护者， 造物主的威力和他神圣的构思， ...

然后他从睡梦中醒来，他睡着时所唱的一切都牢记在脑海里，并立即用相同的韵律9 添加了许多词语到赞美造物主的诗歌中。第二天早上，他来到他的上司庄园管家那里，告诉他他所获得的恩赐。管家立刻把他带到女修道院院长那里，他告知并告诉了她。然后，她指示把所有最博学的人和学生聚集在一起，她要求坎道尔告诉他们他的梦境并唱出这首诗，以便所有被选出来的人都能判断这首诗是什么以及它来自哪里。

(摘自《英国人民的教会史》)

这位女修道院院长的修道院内有一位修士，因善于创作与宗教和虔诚有关的诗歌而声名鹊起。他可以迅速将学者从神圣经文中所学转化为诗歌，以最甜蜜和有灵感的方式装饰，并用英语创作出精美的诗歌…… 

他一直过着世俗生活，直到年老，也从未学过诗。此人曾为一俗人，浑浑噩墨不觉成年，亦未曾学习诗书。他经常参加酒会，当酒会上有人下令，大家轮流在竖琴的伴奏下唱歌，以示欢乐。

当他看到竖琴走近时，他羞愧地从宴会上起身回家。有一次，他正是这样做的，便离开酒会的场所，走到牲畜棚里，那天晚上这个棚子是他照看的。每次见到竖琴趋近，他便面带愧疚，起身离场，径自回家休息。有一次，他离开酒店闹场，来到牲畜栏，按照主人吩咐照看牲畜。

到了一定的时候，他安顿下来，睡着了，一个人梦中站在他面前，叫他，向他问好，并叫他的名字：“凯德蒙，请给我唱首歌吧。”他回答说：“我不会唱歌，所以我离开聚会，来到这里，因为我不会唱任何东西。”跟他说话的人又说：“不过，你得为我唱首歌。”凯德蒙说：“我该唱什么呢？”他说：“给我唱首关于创世的歌。”当他得到这个答案时，他立即开始用他从未听过的诗句和词句来赞美我们的造物主，其编排如下：

 现在赞美天国的守护者， 
造物主的威力和他的构想， …… 

然后他从睡梦中醒来，他睡着时唱的一切都牢牢地记在了他的记忆中，他立即在献给造物主的那首值得赞美的诗的词句中添加了许多相同韵律的词。第二天早上，他来到庄园的长官那里，也就是他的上级；他告诉他获得的恩赐。长官立即把他带到女修道院院长那里，他告诉了她。然后她指示把所有最有学问的人和学生聚集在一起，她让凯德蒙告诉他们他的梦并唱这首诗，这样所有被选中的人都可以判断这首诗是什么，它来自哪里。
