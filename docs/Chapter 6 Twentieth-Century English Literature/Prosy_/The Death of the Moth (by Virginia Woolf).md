## About Virginia Woolf

Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) was born at Hyde Park Gate and had a happy childhood. Her mother's death in 1895 shocked Woolf, and she suffered from mental illness. Years later, her dominating father, a well-known scholar, died, giving her another nervous breakdown. She even attempted to kill herself by jumping from a window. She moved to Bloomsbury and became an integral part of the Bloomsbury Group, which was formed by a coterie of English writers, philosophers, and artists, nourished "on a diet of the arts, learning, amusement, travel, and good living". In 1917, Woolf and her husband founded the Hogarth Press, which published her novels and the works of other contemporary writers and poets, including T. S. Eliot. Woolf's novel Jacob's Room, experimental in form, was published in 1922. This was followed by other writings, particularly Mrs Dalloway (1925) and To the Lighthouse (1927), which critics considered the greatest of Woolf's contributions to modern English literature. Woolf wrote not only literature but also about it. She produced volumes of critical essays. The most important ones were collected in The Common Reader (1925). Another remarkable work by Woolf was A Room of One's Own (1929), a series of lectures in which she famously states that, to be a writer, a woman must have five hundred pounds and a room of her own. She continued her writing career, despite her persistent bouts with mental illness, publishing The Waves (1931), Flush: A Biography (1933), and The Years (1937). 

Woolf's best novels rely upon interior monologues and a prose style that recreates the mental processes of the characters, using "stream of consciousness". The books emphasize the disjointed, illogical quality of the mental-emotional life. Concerned with questions of identity, relationships, time, change, and human personality, Woolf helped shape literary history by writing about, for, and of the modern mind in the modern world. Following each publication, she was besieged by severe depression, and after writing her last book, Between the Acts (1941), she committed suicide, on March 28, by drowning herself in the River Ouse.

## About This Selection

Presented here is Virginia Woolf's most beautiful and fatalistic essay entitled "The Death of the Moth". She watches a moth fluttering back and forth in front of a closed window, tiring itself until it eventually falls to the window sill. There, the moth begins a battle to right itself before death overtakes it. Woolf sees the nature of life as the moth desperately flaps its wings. Despite this, she feels pity for it because it cannot get what it wants— freedom. Eventually, the moth succeeds in regaining its "footing" and stands on the sill before it finally dies. 

Woolf draws the moth as a noble creature with great dignity and perseverance; the author herself becomes emotionally involved in the moth's battle against death, with existential overtones and symbolic references to the moth as a work of art. The main themes in "The Death of the Moth" are threefold: the will to live, the strangeness of life and death, and the mutability and futility of an individual life.

## 关于弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫 

弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫（1882-1941年）出生于海德公园门，在那里度过了一个快乐的童年。母亲于1895年去世震惊了伍尔夫，她也因此患上了精神疾病。多年后，她统治严厉的父亲，一位著名学者去世，导致她再次神经崩溃。她甚至曾试图从窗户跳下来自杀。她搬到了布卢姆斯伯里，并成为了布卢姆斯伯里小组的重要成员，该小组由一群英国作家、哲学家和艺术家组成，他们“以艺术、学问、娱乐、旅行和美食为生”。

1917年，伍尔夫和丈夫创办了霍加斯出版社，出版了她的小说以及其他当代作家和诗人的作品，包括T.S.艾略特。伍尔夫的小说《雅各布的房间》（1922）实验性地以形式出版。随后出版了其他作品，尤其是《达洛维夫人》（1925年）和《到灯塔去》（1927年），评论家认为这是伍尔夫对现代英国文学最伟大的贡献之一。伍尔夫不仅创作文学作品，还写了相关作品。她创作了大量的评论性文章。最重要的作品被收录在《普通读者》（1925）中。伍尔夫的另一部杰出作品是《一个人的房间》（1929），这是一系列讲座，她在其中声称，想要成为作家，一名女性必须拥有五百英镑和独立的房间。尽管精神疾病一直困扰着她，但她继续她的写作生涯，出版了《浪潮》（1931）、《富勒斯：一部传记》（1933）和《岁月》（1937）。 

伍尔夫最好的小说依赖于人物内心独白和模拟人物心智活动的散文风格，使用“意识流”。这些书强调了精神情感生活的不连贯、不合逻辑的特质。关注身份、关系、时间、变化和人格等问题，伍尔夫通过描写、写作并且针对现代思维在现代世界的作品创作了文学历史。在每一次出版之后，她都饱受严重的抑郁症困扰，最后一部著作《表演之间》（1941年）写完后，她于3月28日通过在乌斯河淹死结束了自己的生命。 

## 关于此作品 

这里介绍了弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫最美丽且宿命论的散文名作《蛾的死亡》。她看着一只蛾在关闭的窗户前来回飞舞，一直飞到疲惫，最终落到窗台上。在那里，蛾开始了一场在死亡降临之前挣扎的战斗。伍尔夫看到了蛾拼命拍打翅膀所象征的生命本质。尽管如此，她对蛾感到怜悯，因为它无法得到自由。最终，蛾成功地重新站稳在窗台上，然后最终死去。

伍尔夫描绘了蛾作为一种具有伟大尊严和毅力的高贵生物；作者自己也为蛾对抗死亡的斗争而感到情感上的参与，其中包含了存在主义色彩以及将蛾作为艺术品的象征性参照。《蛾的死亡》中的主题主要有三方面：生存意志、生死奇异性以及个体生命的多变性和徒劳性。
