## About John James Osborne

John James Osborne (1929-1994) was born in Fulham, London, the only son of the family. His father died when he was a young boy, and his relationship with his mother was not a very happy one. His unhappy middle-class childhood and adolescence are vividly portrayed in his autobiography, A Better Class of Person (1981). At fifteen, Osborne was expelled from his school in Devon for hitting a teacher. Three years later, Osborne drifted into his theatre career. 

After working for seven years touring English provincial theatres and writing plays in his spare time, Osborne became an overnight sensation when his third play, Look Back in Anger (1956, published 1957), was performed at the Royal Court Theatre, London. Reviewers immediately praised the play as "the best young play of its decade", and Osborne was described as an "angry young man". This phrase came to designate a whole generation of British male writers, both playwrights and novelists, who came to be known as "the angry young men". Their work was typified by their working-class backgrounds and their irreverence for traditional British values. Osborne's ruthless honesty with language and subject matter inspired a gencration of British playwrights, including Arnold Wesker, John Arden, Harold Pinter, and Tom Stoppard. Osborne's next two plays, The Entertainer (1957, published 1959) and Epitaph for George Dillon (1957, published 1958) were also big hits. Many more plays, television scripts, and film scripts followed in the 1960s and 1970s. Other major plays by Osborne in this period included Luther (1961), a dramatization of the life of Martin Luther; Inadmissible Evidence (1964), in which a middle-aged lawyer tries to justify his disappointing life; and The Hotel in Amsterdam (1968), in which three couples meet in a first-class hotel and define their lives by their hatred of a tyrannical film producer. In 1958, Osborne started his own film business with many projects adapting plays for film, for which he received the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award (1957, 1963) and the Tony Award (1963).

## About Look Back in Anger

This play by John Osborne was first performed in 1956 and published in 1957. The story focuses on a young married couple named Jimmy Porter and Alison Porter and their friend and flatmate, Cliff. It tells how the overeducated and underemployed Jimmy Porter struggles to control his anger, resulting in him lashing out at his wife, Alison. Jimmy runs a candy stand. He is dissatisfied with this job and feels that he deserves more out of life. At Alison's friend Helena's urging, Alison leaves Jimmy. After Alison leaves, Jimmy confronts Helena, and the two move in together and become a couple. Alison, who has miscarried, returns to the house. Helena, feeling guilty, reconciles with Alison and leaves Jimmy. Alison and Jimmy decide to repair their marnage.

## About This Selection

Three segments culled from Act I of Look Back in Anger are presented in this selection. In the first, Jimmy (the "angry young man") and Cliff (Jimmy's flatmate) sit in armchairs, reading newspapers, while Alison, Jimmy's wife, irons in the kitchen area. Jimmy begins to be verbally assaultive to the other two. This quickly grows into a tirade; as the others bicker with him, Jimmy becomes increasingly agitated and abusive. He calls Cliff an ignorant peasant and sarcastically calls his wife "Lady Pusillanimous". Soon, a heated quarrel ensues. This is a routine of life of the three. In the second segment, Jimmy's anger escalates, and he complains that he is bored by the humdrum of Sundays and their life is but a living death. He cries for some enthusiasm to boost him up. Soon Jimmy sets off on another rant about how women are too loud. Jimmy and Cliff engage in a mischievous grabbling. As a consequence, Alison is burned by the iron when the ironing board is toppled in the fray. Jimmy starts to apologize to Alison, but she yells at him to get out of her sight. Jimmy leaves.
