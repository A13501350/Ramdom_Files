## About James Joyce

James Joyce (1882-1941), one of the greatest writers of the early twentieth century, suffered from an incurable case of wanderlust, or diaspora. He was born at Rathgar, Dublin, and educated at the Jesuit schools of Clongowes Wood College and Belvedere College, and at University College Dublin. 

Joyce went to Paris for a year in 1902, where he lived in poverty, wrote verse, and discovered French author Dujardin's novel Les Lauriers sont coupés (1888), which he was later to credit as the source of his own use of interior monologue. During his life, Joyce lived in many different parts of the world. He began his life in Dublin, Ireland, which was the setting for most of his great fiction. In 1903, he returned to Dublin from Paris when his mother was dying. Then he left Ireland almost for good with Nora Baracle, the woman with whom he spent the rest of his life. They lived at Trieste, Italy for some years, where Joyce taught English at the Berlitz school. They moved in 1915 to Zurich and finally settled in after the war in Paris. Joyce's life was a troubled one, with bouts of alcoholism, depression, illness, and poverty. With his perseverance and love of writing backed strongly by his friends in the literary circle, Joyce wrote many influential pieces of literature. Dubliners, a short story collection, was published in 1914, and almost simultancously, a somewhat autobiographical novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man appeared serially in publication; his monumental Ulysses was published in 1922; a small volume of verse, Pomes Penyeach, appeared in 1927; Finnegans Wake, was published in its complete form in 1939. 

These works, particularly Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, revolutionized the form and structure of the modern novel, decisively influenced the development of the "stream of consciousness" or "interior monologue", a narrative technique in fiction which allows the random flow of the narrator's desultory impressions freely go along with his/her rational thoughts. With this unique narrative technique, Joyce pushed language and linguistic experiment to the extreme limits of its communicative function in literature.

## About Ulysses

Ulysses, James Joyce's masterpiece, is a highly complex novel in which the author develops his version of the stream of consciousness. The story takes place during a period of around 18 hours in a single day, each marked by one episode in the novel. Joyce exposes the thoughts and feelings of alienation experienced by Leopold Bloom, an ordinary Irishman who is an advertising salesman. Bloom is gentle, self-effacing, reserved, and peripheralized, more associated with home than the outer world. In the novel, Bloom spends his day out roaming the streets of Dublin against his feelings of inadequacy, always avoiding confrontation and even accepting mockery and disrespect from the "true" Irish. Bloom's wife Molly is involved in a relationship with her agent.
Bloom turns a blind eye to this. Much of the novel consists of Bloom's fantasies, memories, and speculations, which are whimsical, incoherent and daydreaming, a stream of his consciousness.

## About This Selection

Two passages are presented below. The first one is from episode 13, at the end of the day. In that episode, Bloom wanders along a beach, then stands, seeing a limping girl sitting on a rock. He daydreams, giving a world of amorous fancies about the girl, and imagining his and her sexual inclination towards each other. He then becomes obsessed with a dark shadow flying about that gives rise to other fancies. The second one is excerpted from episode 18, in which, Molly, Bloom's wife, lies awake thinking of the people and romances in her life so far. She recalls all of her past lovers, Bloom's courtship, their years together, the rose she wore in her hair the day Bloom asked her to marry him as they stood close under a Moorish arch. Her thoughts flow on while Bloom, the far wanderer of a Dublin day, snores in the darkness by her side. Joyce lays bare his "stream of consciousness" in this part—Molly's fanciful recollection in "free association" flows on in almost 25,000 words without the help of a single punctuation mark.

## 有关詹姆斯·乔伊斯

詹姆斯·乔伊斯（1882-1941）是20世纪初最伟大的作家之一。他患有无法治愈的流浪癖或流亡癖。他出生于都柏林的拉特加，在克朗戈斯伍德学院和贝尔维德学院的耶稣会学校以及都柏林大学学院接受教育。 乔伊斯于1902年前往巴黎一年，在那里过着贫困的生活，写诗，同时发现了法国作家杜雅尔丹的小说《劳里埃被打倒了》（1888），后来他将其归功于自己使用内心独白的来源。乔伊斯一生中居住在世界许多不同的地方。他开始在爱尔兰的都柏林生活，这是他大部分伟大小说的背景。1903年，他的母亲去世后，他从巴黎返回都柏林。随后，他和与之共度余生的女人诺拉·巴拉克尔几乎永远地离开了爱尔兰。他们在意大利的里雅斯特住了几年，乔伊斯在那里的伯利兹学校教英语。1915年，他们搬到了苏黎世，战后最终在巴黎定居。

乔伊斯的生活充满坎坷，酗酒、抑郁、疾病和贫困。凭借着毅力和对写作的热爱，以及文坛朋友的大力支持，乔伊斯写了许多有影响力的文学作品。短篇小说集《都柏林人》出版于1914年，几乎同时，一部有点自传体的小说《一个青年艺术家的画像》连载出版；他的不朽之作《尤利西斯》出版于1922年；小诗集《彭耶奇的诗集》出版于1927年；《芬尼根的守灵夜》于1939年完整出版。 

这些作品，尤其是《尤利西斯》和《芬尼根的守灵夜》彻底改变了现代小说的形式和结构，决定性地影响了“意识流”或“内心独白”的发展，这是小说中的一种叙事技巧，允许叙述者漫无目的的印象自由流动，并自由地与他的理性思维一起流动。凭借这种独特的叙事技巧，乔伊斯将语言和语言实验推向了文学交流功能的极限。
## 有关尤利西斯 

《尤利西斯》是詹姆斯·乔伊斯的杰作，是一部高度复杂的小说，作者在其中发展了他的意识流版本。故事发生在一天的大约18个小时内，每个小时都是小说中的一个情节。乔伊斯揭示了利奥波德·布鲁姆(Leopold Bloom)所经历的疏离感和思想，利奥波德·布鲁姆是一位普通的爱尔兰广告推销员。布鲁姆性格温和、谦逊、内敛、边缘化，与家庭的联系比与外部世界的联系更紧密。在小说中，布鲁姆整天在都柏林街头游荡，以对抗自己的不足感，总是避免与人发生冲突，甚至接受“真正的”爱尔兰人的嘲笑和不尊重。布鲁姆的妻子莫莉与她的经纪人有一段恋情。布鲁姆对此视而不见。小说的大部分内容都是布鲁姆的幻想、回忆和推测，这些幻想、回忆和推测异想天开、语无伦次、白日梦，是他意识中的一股流水。 
## 有关本选集

下面介绍两段文字。第一段来自第13集，一天结束时。在那一集中，布鲁姆在海滩上漫步，然后站起来，看到一个跛脚的女孩坐在岩石上。他做着白日梦，对女孩充满了多情的幻想，想象着他和她对彼此的性倾向。随后，他开始沉迷于飞舞的黑影，并因此产生了其他幻想。

第二段摘录自第18集，其中，布卢姆的妻子莫莉躺在床上，思念着迄今为止她生命中遇到的人和爱情。她回忆起她过去所有的情人、布卢姆的求爱、他们在一起的岁月，以及布卢姆向她求婚那天她头上戴的那朵玫瑰，当时他们正站在摩尔式拱门下。她的思绪飘荡，而布卢姆，这个在都柏林远方流浪的人，在她身边的黑暗中打着呼噜。乔伊斯在这一部分中展现了他的“意识流”——莫莉在“自由联想”中的奇幻回忆在近25,000个单词中流淌，没有一个标点符号的帮助。
