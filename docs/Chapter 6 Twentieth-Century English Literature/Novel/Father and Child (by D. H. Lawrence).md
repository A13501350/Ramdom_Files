## About D. H. Lawrence

D. H. Lawrence (in full David Herbert Lawrence, 1885-1930) was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. His childhood was marked by poverty and family discord. Young Lawrence educated himself by borrowing numerous books from the local libraries. In 1908, he graduated from Nottingham University College. His short stories were published in a local newspaper, and his first poems appeared in print in 1909. Foreseeably, Lawrence's literary career proceeded apace. 

In 1911, a London publisher brought out his novel The White Peacock. This study of the dissolution of a youthful romance exhibited variations on themes featured in Lawrence's later works. His second work, The Trespasser, appeared in 1912, a novel dealing with the conflict between cool-headed and sensual love, in which the protagonist finally hangs himself. Far more important was Sons and Lovers, which was received as a major work soon after its publication in 1913. The next novel, The Rainbow (1915), was immediately suppressed for its sexual theme and its physical exposition. The years of World War I were difficult for Lawrence, but he managed to print various collections of his poems, as well as his first travel study, Twilight in Italy (1916). Another important novel, Women in Love, appeared in print in 1920. This work, like The Rainbow, was roundly condemned for its quest for sexual themes. Lawrence spent his last years in Italy, drafting and revising his Lady Chatterley's Lover (1928), which, in addition to stating more forthrightly themes presented in earlier works, openly defies the convention with his explicit sexual descriptions. The novel was banned immediately. 

D. H. Lawrence is an extraordinarily important author in English literature, regardless of the varied criticism of his works. He faces directly complex human minds and interactions. Much of his work focuses on the physical and emotional relationships between men and women in society, thus drawing its author into considerable controversy.

## About The Rainbow

The Rainbow explores the coming of age, the shift from an agricultural to an industrial economy, religion, and family relationships particularly marriage through the changing attitudes of three generations. The novel's first part follows Tom Brangwen's young adulthood and his marriage to Lydia Lensky. The second part follows Anna Brangwen as she grows up, attends school, and marries Will Brangwen, her step-cousin. Will and Anna's marriage becomes changeable and quarrelsome as soon as they break the solitude of their honeymoon with Anna's decision to host a tea party. Then Will forms a close bond with their eldest daughter, Ursula, after Anna becomes consumed with caring for their second child, conceived before Ursula is ten months old. In the novel's final part, the author follows Ursula Brangwen's late teenage years and early twenties when she meets Anton and falls in love with him.

## About This Selection

The following excerpt presents the beginning of Chapter VIII, "The Child", of Lawrence's novel The Rainbow. Anna and young Will fall in love, with a naive, touching affection for each other.
They marry and live in a cottage, ignoring the world and existing only for themselves. Then Anna gives birth to a daughter. This excerpt describes how the coming of a new baby makes Will feel like a father. Note how Will reacts to his "flesh and blood" and grows to like it and finally enjoys that "brightest, sharpest little ecstasy" of being a father of a little girl.

## 关于 D. H. 劳伦斯

D. H. 劳伦斯（全名戴维·赫伯特·劳伦斯，1885-1930）出生于诺丁汉郡伊斯特伍德。他的童年生活贫困，家庭不和。年轻的劳伦斯从当地图书馆借阅大量书籍自学成才。1908 年，他毕业于诺丁汉大学学院。他的短篇小说发表在当地一家报纸上，他的第一首诗于 1909 年出版。可以预见的是，劳伦斯的文学生涯进展顺利。

1911 年，伦敦一家出版商出版了他的长篇小说《白孔雀》。这部关于青春恋情破裂的研究展示了劳伦斯后期作品中主题的变化。他的第二部作品《侵入者》于 1912 年问世，这部小说讲述了冷静和感性的爱情之间的冲突，主人公最终上吊自杀。更为重要的是《儿子与情人》，该书在 1913 年出版后不久就被誉为一部重要作品。下一部小说《虹》（1915 年）因其性主题和肉体暴露而立即遭到禁售。第一次世界大战的几年对劳伦斯来说是艰难的，但他设法出版了他的各种诗集，以及他的第一部游记《意大利的黄昏》（1916 年）。另一部重要小说《恋爱中的女人》于 1920 年出版。这部作品与《虹》一样，因其对性主题的追求而受到严厉谴责。劳伦斯在意大利度过了他生命的最后几年，起草和修改了他的《查泰莱夫人的情人》（1928 年），除了更直白地陈述早期作品中呈现的主题外，这部小说还以露骨的性描述公然违背了惯例。这部小说立即被禁。 尽管对他的作品的批评多种多样，D.H. 劳伦斯仍然是英国文学中一位极其重要的作家。他直面复杂的人类思想和互动。他的大部分作品都关注社会中男女之间的身体和情感关系，因此作者也因此陷入了相当大的争议。
