## About Joseph Conrad

Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) was born into a landowning family in Poland. His father was an outspoken poet, dramatist and translator who was exiled to Russia, where Conrad's mother died when he was seven. Five years later, his father died of the same disease. Thereafter Conrad was raised chiefly by his uncle, who insisted on the importance of education to the boy. He read widely and was familiar with the works of some great authors of the West. Conrad was also a lover of travel books and had always been attracted to the sea. In 1874, he went to Marseille and became a sailor, picking up odd jobs on ships and travelling throughout the Caribbean. Deep in debt, Conrad suffered depression. He even attempted suicide carly in 1878. He sailed three times to Australia in three years, twice to Singapore, twice to India, and at least once to Java. In 1884, Conrad became a naturalized British citizen. In 1890, he sailed to the Congo, during which time he witnessed the cruelty of British imperialism and the miserable living conditions of the natives, and suffered nearly fatal attacks of dysentery and fever. 

In 1894, he settled in England to devote his time to writing novels. With John Galsworthy's help, Conrad published his first novel, Almayer's Folly, in 1895, followed by his second, An Outcast of the Islands, the following year. In yearly succession, Conrad published The Nigger of the "Narcissus" in 1897, which tells the story of a black sailor in pain; Heart of Darkness in 1899, in which Marlow tells his journey up the Congo River; and Lord Jim (1900), which is about the story of an outcast and a wanderer on the sea. Conrad began to establish his reputation as a successful novelist. From then on, Conrad went on to publish more novels and story collections, and he even tried his hand at writing plays. His writing continued until his death in 1924 when he was engaged in writing his final book, Suspense: A Napoleonic Novel, published one year after his death. Reading Conrad's works, the reader can sense his striving after symbolic sensory expression, tone, and colour. As a prose stylist, Conrad created his own impressionistic fictional method for which he is often known.

## About Heart of Darkness

On the steamboat *Nellie*, Charles Marlow, the narrator, and his companions are sailing down the River Thames. Reminded of his travel in the Congo, Marlow remarks that London is also a dark place. He then tells his companions about his journey in Africa years before. The novella then transitions to a first-person recounting of Marlow's sail down the coast of Africa and along the Congo River to find Mr Kurtz and bring him back. After hardship and perilous events on the way, Marlow finally arrives at the Inner Station for the ivory trade and meets Kurtz, a mysterious man who is able to secure more ivory from the native villages. Marlowe convinces Kurtz to return to Europe against the natives' will, but Kurtz dies before he can make it. Marlow ends his narrative as the Nellie reaches the mouth of the Thames, and he again notes that the waterway seems to lead into a heart of darkness.

## About This Selection

The following two episodes are taken from the beginning and ending scenes of Heart of Darkness. In the first, Marlow and his fellow sailors are sailing down the River Thames, looking at London covered in the dusky hue from afar. Marlow tells his companion about the imperial glory of the river in history but also comments that London "has been one of the dark places of the earth." In the second, Marlow is at the Central Station in Congo, looking at the dying Kurtz in darkness, who cries "The horror! The horror!" and then dies. The two scenes echo one another to imply the theme of the novella. The literary darkness and psychological darkness reverberate to mock British imperialism and colonialism.
