## About E. M. Forster

E. M. Forster (in full Edward Morgan Forster, 1879-1970) was the only child in his family. His father died when he was only one year old. Yet he had a happy childhood living with his mother. At eighteen, Forster went to study at King's College, Cambridge. Forster studied classics for three years and history for his fourth year. During that time, he was elected to the Apostles, a secret and long-established society whose goal was to pursue truth and ethical righteousness through serious conversations and discussions among its members. Forster graduated from Cambridge in 1901, the same year that Queen Victoria died. 

After leaving Cambridge, he travelled in Europe, which provided material for his early writing. When he returned to England, he moved with his mother to Weybridge, Surrey, where he wrote all six of his novels. Among his works are: Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905), The Longest Journey (1907), 4 Room with a View (1908), Howards End (1910), Maurice (1971), Alexandria: A History and a Guide (1922), and Pharos and Pharillon
(1923), a collection of essays written during his wartime service in the Red Cross in Egypt.
Notably in 1914, Forster visited Egypt, Germany, and India. During this stay in India, he learned about the Hindus as he had previously learned about the Muslims. He went to India again in 1921. After returning to London from India, he completed his masterpiece A Passage to India (1924), the last novel of his to be published in his lifetime, and the one that established his reputation as one of the dominant figures in English literature. 

One central theme throughout most of Forster's works stands out most pre-eminently: it is an examination of the English class system and its impact on his characters' personal lives. Also of particular interest to Forster was the intersection of class and race. The Passage to India, for instance, expresses human failure to connect across class and race in the context of England's decline as a colonial power. This central concern in the novel typically illustrates the humanistic and liberal concern that he held as a member of the famous Bloomsbury Group in London from the 1910s to 1920s. In 1927, Forster was invited to give lectures at Cambridge, which were then published as Aspects of the Novel
(1927). This book is one of the most outstanding works on the art of fiction published in England during the first half of the century.
## About Howards End

Howards End deals with the human connection between private and public life, between individuals within the middle class. The story tells how difficult it is to create and sustain these connections. It focuses mainly on two families: the Schlegels, who represent intellectualism, imagination and idealism, and the Wilcoxes, who care more about business, commerciality, and the modern life of practical England. 

In the novel, Helen Schlegel, wildly idealistic and class-biased, is drawn to the Wilcox family and falls briefly in love with Paul Wilcox. Helen's sister Margaret becomes more deeply involved in the connection. She is aware of the very differences in their way of life and acknowledges the value of intellectuals to a stable, secure and practical life. She marries Henry Wilcox, to the alarm of both families, and her love and steadiness of purpose are tested by the ensuing tensions and misunderstandings. In the end, torn between her sister and her husband, she succeeds in bridging the mistrust that divides them. Howards End, where the story begins and ends, is the house that symbolizes human dignity and endurance, and according to some critics, England itself.


## About This Selection

These three paragraphs are taken from Chapter XIII of Forster's Howards End. They show a sprawling London wrapped up in grey air caused by the expansion of the industry. Note how desperate the author is when he describes the smog in London, saying that the city as a whole is "exhaling her exhausted air". 

In a sense, this excerpt expresses one of the novel's themes, namely, in the pursuit of modern industry and commercialism, people have lost their connectedness in cities that have become increasingly apathetic to human needs.

## E. M. 福斯特的传记

E. M. 福斯特（全名 Edward Morgan Forster，1879-1970）是家中的独生子。他父亲在他一岁时就去世了。然而，他与母亲度过了一个快乐的童年。十八岁那年，福斯特进入剑桥大学国王学院求学。他先学习了三年的古典文学，然后第四年转为历史专业。在那段时光里，他被选入了使徒会这个古老而神秘的社团，他们追求真理和道德正义，通过成员之间的深刻对话和讨论来实现这一目标。福斯特于 1901 年毕业于剑桥大学，也是维多利亚女王逝世的那一年。 

离开剑桥后，他游历欧洲，为他早期写作提供了灵感。之后回到英国，他与母亲搬到了威布里奇的萨里郡，在那里，他创作了六部小说。这些作品包括：《天使不敢涉足的地方》（1905 年）、《最长的旅程》（1907 年）、《4 间看得见风景的房间》（1908 年）、《霍华德庄园》（1910 年）、《莫里斯》（1971 年）、《亚历山大：历史与指南》（1922 年）、以及《法罗斯与法里隆》（1923 年），后者是他在埃及红十字会服役期间写成的一部散文集。 值得注意的是，1914 年，福斯特游历了埃及、德国和印度。在印度逗留期间，他深入了解了印度教徒，就像之前了解穆斯林一样。1921 年，他再次前往印度。回到伦敦后，他完成了杰作《印度之行》（1924 年），这也是他一生中发表的最后一部小说，也是他作为英国文学领袖之一的声望的体现之作。 


福斯特的许多作品都围绕一个核心主题展开，那就是探讨英国的阶级制度及其对个人生活的影响。他尤其对阶级和种族之间的交集感兴趣。例如，《印度之行》表达了在英国作为殖民帝国衰落的大背景下，人们未能跨越阶级和种族之间建立联系的主题。小说中这一核心关注点典型地表现了他作为 1910 年代至 1920 年代伦敦著名布卢姆斯伯里派成员所持有的人文主义和自由主义关切。1927 年，福斯特在剑桥大学发表了一系列演讲，后来这些演讲结集成《小说面面观》（1927 年）一书，成为上世纪英国最杰出的小说艺术作品之一之列。 

## 《霍华德庄园》述评 

《霍华德庄园》涉及个人生活与公共生活、中产阶级个体之间的人际关系。故事讲述了建立和维护这些联系的艰难。小说主要聚焦两个家族：代表知识分子、想象力和理想主义的施莱格尔家族，以及更关注商业、实用主义和英国现代生活的威尔科克斯家族。 

小说里，海伦·施莱格尔是一个极度理想主义和阶级偏见的人物，她被威尔科克斯家族所吸引，短暂地爱上了保罗·威尔科克斯。海伦的妹妹玛格丽特对这段关系更有深刻的理解。她意识到他们生活方式的不同，认识到知识分子对稳定、安全和务实生活的价值。她最终嫁给了亨利·威尔科克斯，这让两个家庭都感到震惊，她的爱与果敢的目标在随之而来的紧张和误解中受到考验。最终，她成功地化解了姐姐和丈夫之间的矛盾。

故事开始和结束于《霍华德庄园》，这一地方象征着人类的尊严和忍耐，一些评论认为，它也象征着英格兰本身。 

## 此选集简评 

摘自福斯特的《霍华德庄园》第十三章，展示了一个大伦敦被工业扩张所带来的灰蒙蒙的环境。请留意作者对伦敦雾气的描述多么绝望，他说整座城市都“弥漫着疲倦的空气”。 在某种程度上，这些摘录体现了小说的一个主题，即人们在追求现代工业和商业主义的过程中，在越来越漠不关心人类需求的城市中失去了联系。
