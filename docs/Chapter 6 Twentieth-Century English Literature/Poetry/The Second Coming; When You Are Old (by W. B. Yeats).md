## About W. B. Yeats

W. B. Yeats (in full William Butler Yeats, 1865-1939) was born in Sandymount, Dublin. His father wanted him to be a painter, but William found his talents in poetry. Under the influence of William Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley and others, Yeats grew to be a Romanticist. He published an epic poem, "The Wanderings of Oisin" in 1889, based on Irish mythology. Yeats declares, "Words alone are certain good", and reality and facts are but products of imagination. His second collection of poetry, The Rose (1893), vaguely expressed his inclination to mysticism, a new religion. He also grew interested in the theatre, Irish culture and politics in the late 1890s. As a result, Yeats's style and subject matter began to change from the shadowy Romanticism of the early poems to the satiric and realistic poems found in the 1914 volume, Responsibilities: Poems and a Play. This book remade him as a modern poet. The first aspect of that modernity is a satiric rather than a Romantic approach. During this period, Yeats met Ezra Pound, who introduced him to Japanese No drama, which fascinated him. He wrote and produced At the Hawk's Well in 1916 with Japanese-like masks. Another event that altered Yeats was the Easter Uprising of 1916. He responded to the revolutionary politics with "Easter 1916". The poem describes how everything has been "changed, changed utterly" by the actions of a few heroic fanatics. One of Yeats's greatest collections is The Tower (1928), and it reflects much of the biterness he perceived in the civil war in freland and the breakdown of old traditions after World War I. The Winding Stair and Other: Poems (1933) was the next new volume after The Tower. In this collection, the poems celebrate life and the victory of the "Self" over the abstraction of the "Soul". Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize for his poetry in 1923.

## About This Selection

Two poems by Yeats are collected below. "The Second Coming" was written in 1919, soon after the end of World War I. The poem describes a powerful alternative to the Christian idea of the Second Coming-Jesus's prophesied return to the Earth as a saviour of humankind. The poem's first stanza describes a world on the brink of doomed, chaotic, disorderly and painful destruction. The second stanza imagines the speaker receiving a vision of the future, but this vision replaces Jesus's glorious return with what seems to be the arrival of an ugly and evil beast. With its distinct imagery and vivid description of collapsing society, "The Second Coming" has this message: the time is up for humanity, and human civilization as we know it is about to be undone.

In the other poem, "When You are Old", the speaker asks someone to think ahead to old age, strongly suggesting that the addressee will eventually regret being unwilling to return the speaker's love. Most critics agree that the poem is about Yeats's relationship with Maud Gonne, an Irish actress and nationalist.

## 关于威廉·巴特勒·叶芝

威廉·巴特勒·叶芝（全名William Butler Yeats，1865-1939年）出生在都柏林的桑迪芒特。他的父亲希望他成为一名画家，但威廉发现自己的才华在诗歌方面。在威廉·布莱克（William Blake）、珀西·比西·雪莱（Percy Bysshe Shelley）等人的影响下，叶芝成长为一位浪漫主义者。他于1889年发表了一首史诗诗歌《奥辛的游历》（The Wanderings of Oisin），以爱尔兰神话为基础。叶芝宣称：“唯独词语是确定的善”，现实和事实仅仅是想象的产物。他的第二部诗集《玫瑰》（The Rose，1893年）模糊地表达了他对神秘主义和新宗教的倾向。后来在19世纪末，他对戏剧、爱尔兰文化和政治产生了兴趣。结果，叶芝的风格和主题开始从早期诗歌中阴影般的浪漫主义变化为1914年发表的諷刺和现实主义诗歌，收录在《责任：诗歌和剧本》（Responsibilities: Poems and a Play）中。这本书使他重新塑造为现代诗人。这种现代性的第一个方面是讽刺而非浪漫的态度。在这一时期，叶芝遇到了埃兹拉·庞德（Ezra Pound），庞德向他介绍了日本Noh剧，这深深吸引了他。1916年，他写作并上演了《禾枝井边》（At the Hawk's Well），采用类似日本面具的设计。另一个改变叶芝的事件是1916年爱尔兰复活节起义。他以《1916年复活节》（Easter 1916）回应了革命政治。这首诗描述了一群英雄般的狂热者的行动改变了一切，“万变，万变”。叶芝最伟大的诗集之一是《塔》（The Tower，1928），反映了他在爱尔兰内战和第一次世界大战后旧传统瓦解中所感知到的苦涩。《旋梯及其他：诗歌》（The Winding Stair and Other: Poems，1933年）是继《塔》之后的下一个新集。在这个集合中，这些诗歌颂扬生命，宣扬“自我”战胜“灵魂”的抽象。叶芝于1923年因其诗歌被授予了诺贝尔奖。

## 关于本选集

以下收录了叶芝的两首诗歌。《第二次降临》（The Second Coming）写于1919年，就在第一次世界大战结束后不久。这首诗描绘了耶稣预言的第二次降临-耶稣作为拯救人类的救世主再次降临地球的一个强大的替代形象。诗歌的第一节描述了一个处于崩溃边缘的世界，注定要走向毁灭、混乱、无序和痛苦。第二节设想了说话者接收到一个未来的幻象，但这个幻象取代了耶稣辉煌归来的场面，而是似乎是一个丑陋和邪恶的怪兽的到来。凭借其独特的意象和对崩溃社会的生动描述，《第二次降临》传达了这个信息：人类的时间将就此终结，人类文明即将被毁灭。

在另一首诗歌《当你年老时》（When You are Old）中，说话者要求某人展望老年，强烈暗示收信人最终会后悔未能回报说话者的爱。大多数评论家都认为这首诗是关于叶芝与莫德·冈（Maud Gonne）之间的关系。
