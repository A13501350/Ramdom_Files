W. H. Auden (in full Wystan Hugh Auden, 1907-1973) was born in York, England. He received a formal education at good schools. Auden entered Oxford in 1925 and soon became a rising star in poetry and in thinking. After graduation, he travelled to Germany, where he became acquainted with the plays of Bertolt Brecht. Throughout his life, he was influenced by classical and modern German literature. Auden became a schoolmaster when he returned to England, and his literary reputation grew. His Poems appeared in 1930, establishing his name as the most brilliant of England's younger generation of poets. 

His first dramatic work, Paid on Both Sides: A Charade (1930) reinforced his reputation. Before 1932, Auden's poems were mostly "Freudian"; he viewed the work of this period as a kind of therapy, giving free play to fantasy and uncovering hidden impulses. By 1933, partly under the influence of Brecht, Auden became an outspoken critic of the political establishment. He joined the war in Spain against the forces of fascism and wrote film scripts about working-class life in Britain. Then in 1939, disillusioned with the political climate in Europe at the time, Auden moved to America and taught courses at the University of Michigan, writing poems of meditative introspection. The last of these, The Age of Anxiety (1947), earned him the Pulitzer Prize in 1948. His The Dyer's Hand, and Other Essays and A Certain World, two volumes of prose, appeared in 1962 and 1970. In 1972, Auden returned to live in Oxford, where he had been named Professor of Poetry.

## About This Selection

Two poems by Auden are collected below. The first, "The Sphinx", shows that the poet is good at using actual places for his poetic meditation, mixing the historical locations with symbolic forces of orientation. Thus, Sphinx, the monster in W. B. Yeats's "The Second Coming" appears to the readers as a huge, silent sculpture that neither accuses nor pardons but always suffers in the "hot invaded land" which calls for the reader's imagination. 

The other poem, "Our Bias", expresses the poet's concept of time and the wrongfulness of the biased human judgment of the time. Auden points out that the objective measurement of time never curtails the human strive for success and love based on the biased understanding and use of time.

## 关于 W. H. 奥登

W. H. 奥登（全名 Wystan Hugh Auden，1907-1973 年）生于英格兰约克。他接受了优质学校的正规教育。奥登于 1925 年进入牛津大学，很快在诗歌和思维领域成为一颗冉冉升起的明星。毕业后，他前往德国，并熟悉了贝托尔特·布莱希特的戏剧。终其一生，他受到古典和现代德国文学的影响。奥登回到英格兰后成为了一名中学教师，他的文学声誉逐渐增长。他的诗集于 1930 年出版，确立了他作为英国年轻一代中最杰出诗人的名声。

他的第一部戏剧作品《两面受敌：一个字谜》（1930 年）加强了他的声誉。在 1932 年之前，奥登的诗歌大多是“弗洛伊德式”的；他认为这一时期的作品是一种疗法，给幻想以自由发挥，揭示隐藏的冲动。到了 1933 年，部分受布莱希特影响，奥登成为政治立场鲜明的批评家。他参加了西班牙反法西斯主义的战争，并写了有关英国工人阶级生活的电影剧本。然后在 1939 年，对当时欧洲政治氛围感到幻灭后，奥登搬到美国，在密歇根大学教授课程，并写了一些沉思性的诗歌。其中的精神疗法，《焦虑的时代》（1947 年），使他于 1948 年获得了普利策奖。他的散文集《染布工的手》和《某个世界》分别于 1962 年和 1970 年出版。1972 年，奥登回到牛津定居，被授予诗歌教授的称号。 

## 关于本文选

以下收录了奥登的两首诗。第一首诗《斯芬克斯》表明诗人善于利用实际地点进行诗意冥想，将历史地点与象征性导向力量混合起来。因此，《斯芬克斯》，即《威廉·巴特勒·叶芝》的《第二次降临》中的怪兽在读者眼中是一尊巨大的沉默的雕塑，既不指责也不宽恕，但却一直在“炎热侵占的土地”中受苦，呼唤读者的想象力。

另一首诗《我们的偏见》表达了诗人对时间的概念以及人类对时间的偏见判断的错误性。奥登指出，客观时间的测量永远不会限制人类基于偏见理解和利用时间而努力追求成功和爱。
