### **Utopia and the "sheep eating people"**

Criticism of early capitalist exploitation: Through the metaphor of "sheep eating people", Moore deeply exposed the cruel exploitation and oppression of the working people during the primitive accumulation period of capitalism, and showed his compassion for the people at the bottom of society.

- Enclosure Movement: The enclosure movement, which took place in England in the 16th century, was an important way of capitalist primitive accumulation. Landowners, through violence or legal means, appropriated public land and peasant plots for the development of wool production, resulting in a large number of farmers losing their land and livelihoods and becoming displaced proletarians.

- The predatory nature of capitalism: During the period of primitive accumulation of capitalism, capitalists brutally exploited working people through various means, including low wages, long working hours, and poor working conditions. This predatory way of accumulation has caused huge social problems, and also triggered criticism from thinkers such as Moore.

The meaning of Moore's "sheep eat men" parable:

- Exposing the nature of capitalism: By using the metaphor of "sheep eating people", More vividly exposed the plunder and exploitation of working people by capitalists during the period of primitive accumulation of capitalism, reflecting his criticism of the capitalist system.

- Arouse people's reflection: Moore's metaphor has a strong warning significance, reminding people of the shortcomings of the capitalist system and the harm caused to society, and calling on people to reflect on and criticize social injustice.

- Reflecting humanistic concern: Moore's metaphors reflect his deep sympathy and humanistic concern for the working people, and express his pursuit of social justice.

### Meaning of the Contract with the Devil in Christopher Marlowe's play "Doctor Faustus"

The excerpt from Christopher Marlowe's play "Doctor Faustus" portrays Faustus' descent into damnation through a pact with Mephistophilis, the devil. Here's an analysis of the symbolic meaning behind the contract:

- **Temptation and Knowledge:** Faustus craves power and knowledge beyond human limitations. Mephistophilis tempts him with wealth, pleasures, and the ability to perform magic, all in exchange for his soul. This symbolizes the allure of forbidden knowledge and the Faustian bargain - achieving greatness at a terrible cost.
    
- **Free Will vs. Eternal Damnation:** Faustus ignores the Good Angel's pleas and readily signs the contract despite the blood inscription "Homo, fuge" (Latin: Fly, human) appearing on his arm, a warning of his impending doom. This signifies the dangers of succumbing to temptation and the potential for humans to make choices that lead to eternal suffering.
    
- **The Nature of Hell:** Mephistophilis describes hell as existing everywhere and not being confined to a specific location. He states, "where we are is hell," implying that a guilty conscience and damnation are internal states. This challenges the traditional view of hell as a fiery underworld.
    

**Characters and their Symbolism:**

- **Doctor Faustus:** Represents the thirst for knowledge and power that can lead to moral downfall.
    
- **Mephistophilis:** The embodiment of temptation and evil, who preys on Faustus' ambition.
    
- **Good and Evil Angels:** Represent the internal struggle between good and evil conscience within Faustus.
    
- **Devil disguised as a woman:** Represents fleeting pleasures and the deception of earthly desires.
    

**Overall, the contract with the devil serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of ambition and the importance of considering the consequences of one's actions.**

### Dryden's prose style 

can be characterized by the following features:

- **Conversational:** He uses a clear and direct style that mimics everyday speech. Phrases like "How easy it is..." and "a plain piece of work" create a sense of informality.
- **Witty and Playful:** He employs humor and clever comparisons, such as the executioner and his wife's remark. This wit is used to make his points more engaging.
- **Analytical:** He breaks down complex ideas into manageable parts. For instance, he explains the "mystery" of satire by using the metaphor of drawing a face.
- **Reasoned Argument:** He uses logic and evidence to support his claims. For example, he argues that a satirical attack disguised as wit is more effective than direct insults.
- **Allusion:** He includes references to historical figures like Jack Ketch to add depth and context to his writing.

In summary, Dryden's prose is a blend of clarity, wit, and reason, making his writing not only informative but also enjoyable to read.

### The Task of a Satirist

The text argues that true satire is a subtle art, far more effective than simply calling someone names.

- **Direct Insults Are Easy:** It's easy to bluntly call someone a villain or scoundrel, even wittily.
- **True Art Lies in Subtlety:** The real challenge lies in making someone appear foolish, dull-witted, or dishonest without resorting to insults.

The author emphasizes the skill of a satirist:

- **Like a Masterful Artist:** A great satirist exposes a person's flaws subtly, like drawing a face where the nose and cheeks protrude without harsh shadows.
- **Untaught Skill:** This is the essence of the "noble trade" of satire, a skill a master cannot directly teach. One can learn the rules, but applying them effectively requires talent.

The text then argues that good satire isn't truly offensive:

- **The Witty Appreciate It:** A clever person might feel the sting of satire but also appreciate its ingenuity.
- **Fools Miss the Point:** A fool wouldn't even understand the satire, let alone be offended by it.

**Analogy of Butchers vs. Expert:**

- **Crude vs. Skilled:** The difference between a good satirist and a bad one is like the difference between a clumsy butcher and a skilled executioner.
    - A clumsy butcher hacks away, while a skilled executioner delivers a swift and clean blow.

**Dryden's Personal Example:**

- **Simple vs. Masterful:** The author uses his own poem, "Absalom," as an example. He argues that the portrayal of a character (Zimri) is more effective satire than outright insults.
    - The character is not portrayed as violent, but rather ridiculous.
    - The target, a witty person, recognized the satire but couldn't take offense because it wasn't a direct attack.

The text concludes by highlighting the success of this approach:

- **Laughing at the Mocker:** By using wit and humor, the author avoided punishment and achieved his goal.
- The target, who initially mocked others, became the laughingstock.


### Bacon's Writing Style and Views on Family

Based on the selected text, here's what we can learn about Bacon's writing style and views on family:

**Writing Style:**

- **Aphoristic:** Bacon uses short, pithy statements that convey wisdom or general principles. Examples include: "Children sweeten labours, but they make misfortunes more bitter" and "Wives are young men's mistresses, companions for middle age, and old men's nurses."
- **Formal and Concise:** He employs formal language and avoids unnecessary elaboration.
- **Use of Examples and Contrasts:** He clarifies his points with examples and contrasting ideas often expressed in short sentences.

**Views on Parents and Children:**

- **Parents' Role:** Bacon emphasizes the importance of parents guiding their children's career paths early on. However, he advises against forcing a child's interests.
- **Parental Love:** He acknowledges the uneven affection parents may have for their children, particularly mothers favoring their sons.
- **Value of Children:** While acknowledging the challenges children bring, Bacon recognizes their role in continuing family legacies and motivating accomplishments. He sees childless men as more likely to dedicate themselves to grand pursuits.

**Views on Marriage and Single Life:**

- **Marriage:** Bacon views marriage as a potential hindrance to ambitious goals. He suggests the greatest contributions come from unmarried men. However, he acknowledges the importance of family continuity and the care parents have for their children's future.
- **Single Life:** He sees advantages to being single, such as greater freedom and suitability for certain professions. However, he criticizes those who choose single life solely for financial gain or to avoid responsibility.
- **Husband-Wife Roles:** Bacon offers stereotypical views on spousal roles. He sees wives as progressing from mistresses to companions to nurses throughout a marriage. He warns against jealousy and emphasizes the importance of a wife believing in her husband's wisdom.

**It's important to note:** Bacon's views on family reflect the social norms of his time and may not resonate entirely with modern readers.

### John Donne

**Metaphysical Poetry**

- Refers to a style of poetry prominent in the 17th century, known for its:
    - Philosophical themes
    - Witty use of language (conceits)
    - Everyday imagery
    - Focus on complex ideas and emotions

Donne's metaphysical poetry offered a model for 20th-century modernist poets to be intellectually rigorous, emotionally complex, and formally innovative while still grappling with timeless themes.

**Conceit and Exaggeration in "The Sun Rising"**

- The poem uses an **extended metaphor** (conceit) comparing the lovers in bed to the center of the universe.
- The speaker exaggerates the power of their love, claiming it supersedes the sun and time itself.
- Hyperbole is used throughout to emphasize the absolute value of their love.

**Writing Style of "Death, Be not Proud"**

- The poem uses **personification**, addressing death directly.
- **Rhetorical questions** are used to challenge the power and fear of death.
- The language is calmer and more reasoned compared to the passionate tone of "The Sun Rising."

The Sun Rising is a love poem written by John Donne that expresses the poet's strong feelings for his lover and his complaints about the sun. The poem uses rich imagination conceit and exaggeration. The poet personifies the sun, thinking that the sun disturbs the pleasure of him and his lover, and expresses the poet's ardent love.

The Sun Rising 是约翰·多恩 (John Donne) 所作的情诗，表达了诗人对爱人的强烈情感以及对太阳的抱怨。这首诗运用了丰富的想象力和夸张的手法,诗人将太阳拟人化，认为太阳在打扰他和爱人的欢愉,表达了诗人炽热的爱意。

### Language Style and Religious Color 

**On Time**

- **Personification:** Time is addressed directly as a negative force ("envious Time").
- **Hyperbole:** The speaker urges Time to "fly envious Time, till thou run out thy race" emphasizing their desire for it to end quickly.
- **Religious imagery:** The poem uses concepts like "Eternity" and "heavenly-guided soul" to depict a blissful afterlife.

**On His Blindness**

- **Formal language:** The sonnet uses a structured rhyme scheme and iambic pentameter, reflecting a more formal tone.
- **Biblical allusion:** The reference to the parable of the talents (**Talent** in note 3) connects the poem to Christian themes of service and responsibility to God.
- **Figurative language:** Simile ("Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent / To serve therewith my Maker") expresses the speaker's frustration.

### Difference Between "Time" and "Eternity"

- **Time** is portrayed as a negative force associated with "mortality," "vanity," and "change."
- **Eternity** represents a positive ideal state beyond Time, characterized by "bliss," "Joy," and "Truth."

### Meaning of "Talent" in "On His Blindness"

In "On His Blindness," "Talent" refers to the speaker's **poetic ability** and his **capacity to serve God**. Milton sees his blindness as hiding this talent, preventing him from fulfilling his purpose. It connects to the parable of the talents (note 3) where a servant who buries his talent is punished.

### Act I, Scene II of Shakespeare's play Hamlet. 

It mainly presents the conflict between Hamlet and Claudius, and Hamlet's inner conflict. Hamlet is disgusted by his uncle's usurpation of the throne and marriage to his mother, and he is determined to avenge his father. However, he is also torn between love for his mother and hatred for his uncle. Hamlet's soliloquy reveals his complex character and inner thoughts, and it plays an important role in moving the plot forward.

Hamlet's monologue is the key to understanding his inner world, revealing Hamlet's complex character and ideological contradictions

### The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire

- **Loss of Military Strength:** The Roman Empire came to rely on mercenary soldiers from conquered territories, leading to a decline in patriotism and fighting spirit among native citizens.
- **Stagnation and Indifference:** Long periods of peace and a uniform style of government led to a lack of innovation and a general apathy among the people.
- **Decline in Education and Culture:** While there was a focus on education during some periods, it became rigid and uninspired, stifling creativity and original thought.
- **Over-reliance on Past Masters:** Education focused heavily on imitating the works of past Greek and Roman writers, hindering the development of new ideas and voices.

Gibbon suggests that these factors combined to weaken the Roman Empire from within, making it vulnerable to external pressures.

### "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard" by Thomas Gray

Reflects on the lives of the common people buried in a rural churchyard. It contemplates the universal themes of life, death, and the unfulfilled potential of the obscure. Here are some key points:

- **Mortality and Equality**: The poem emphasizes the inevitability of death and the equalizing effect it has on all, regardless of social status.
- **Unrealized Potential**: It laments the talents and virtues that remain unknown due to the obscurity of the rural poor.
- **Nature's Reflection**: The poem uses nature, such as the beetle's flight and the owl's complaint, to mirror the somber mood and provide a sense of continuity with the cycle of life and death.

Gray employs anthropomorphism by attributing human characteristics to elements of nature, like the moping owl and the beetle, to evoke emotion and reflect on the human condition.


### **Middle-class life and ideal in The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe**

The middle-class life and ideal in The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe is one of comfort, security, and peace. It is a life that is free from the extremes of wealth and poverty, and that is characterized by hard work, thrift, and self-reliance.

The middle-class ideal is embodied in the character of Robinson Crusoe himself. Crusoe is a self-made man who has achieved success through his own hard work and determination. He is a skilled craftsman and a shrewd businessman. He is also a devout Christian who believes in the importance of hard work and moral living.

Crusoe's life on the island is a microcosm of the middle-class ideal. He is forced to rely on his own resources to survive, and he must learn to be self-sufficient. He also learns the importance of hard work and thrift. Through his experiences on the island, Crusoe comes to appreciate the simple things in life, and he realizes that true happiness comes from within, not from material possessions.

The middle-class ideal is also reflected in the other characters in the novel. Friday, Crusoe's manservant, is a loyal and hardworking individual who is grateful for Crusoe's kindness and protection. The other castaways, who are all middle-class, are also hardworking and self-reliant. They work together to create a new life for themselves on the island, and they eventually achieve a measure of success.

The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe is a classic tale of the middle-class ideal. It is a story of hard work, thrift, self-reliance, and the importance of community. It is a story that has resonated with readers for centuries, and it continues to inspire people today.

### Yahoos in Gulliver's Travels 

Swift has a very negative view of human society. Here's how the passage portrays his opinion:

- **Yahoos as Humans:** The Yahoos are filthy, hairy creatures who walk on two legs and fight with their claws. This grotesque description is meant to be a direct reflection of humanity. Swift is suggesting that humans are no better than animals when it comes to their behavior.
    
- **Gulliver's Disgust:** Gulliver's initial reaction to the Yahoos is one of horror and disgust. He finds them to be the most disagreeable creatures he has ever encountered. This reaction indicates Swift's belief that human nature is inherently flawed and repulsive.
    
- **Superiority of Horses:** The Houyhnhnms, the race of intelligent horses, are presented as the complete opposite of the Yahoos. They are rational, civilized, and live in harmony with nature. This contrast highlights Swift's view that humans have strayed from a more ideal state and could learn a lot from living a more natural and virtuous life.
    
- **Gulliver's Changed Perspective:** After spending time with the Houyhnhnms, Gulliver can't help but see his own kind as filthy Yahoos. This emphasizes Swift's point that human society is corrupt and filled with vice.
    

**Overall, the passage uses satire to criticize human flaws and societal problems. Swift suggests that humans are capable of great reason but often choose to act base and barbaric.**

### Wordsworth's Romantic Emotion in the Description of Mountain Tarns

The passage from Wordsworth's "A Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England" showcases several key aspects of his Romantic sensibility in his description of the mountain tarns. Here's a breakdown of these emotions:

- **Awe and Sublimity:** Wordsworth emphasizes the "grand" nature of the tarns, their remoteness, and the "huge stones and masses of rock." These elements evoke a sense of awe and the sublime, a feeling cherished by Romantics who valued the overwhelming power and vastness of nature.
    
- **Melancholy and Tranquility:** The "not unpleasing sadness" and the "melancholy natural to such scenes" highlight a Romantic fascination with melancholy. The tarns' isolation and "images of decay" create a sense of quiet contemplation and a connection to the power of time.
    
- **Solitude and Imagination:** The "solitude" of the tarns is "often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed." This solitude isn't a negative aspect, but rather a space for the imagination to flourish. Wordsworth suggests that the "imagination" populates these lonely places with "voluntary power," finding meaning in the breeze and the light.
    
- **Appreciation for the Untamed:** The "naked" mountains and the tarns' difficulty of access suggest a preference for the untamed and wild aspects of nature. Romantics valued nature untouched by human intervention, and the tarns represent this ideal.
    
- **Connection with Nature:** Despite the melancholy, there's an underlying sense of connection. The tarns are "an acceptable sight" to the "mountain wanderer," offering a point of reference in the landscape. The "lonely Angler" further suggests a human connection to this wild place.
    

Overall, Wordsworth's description of the mountain tarns isn't simply a factual account. It's a canvas upon which he projects his Romantic emotions – awe, melancholy, solitude, and a deep appreciation for the untamed beauty of nature.

### Genius and Novelty

Coleridge, in this excerpt from "Genius and Novelty," showcases a profound and multifaceted approach to the concepts of genius and the power of novelty in both philosophy and art. Here's a breakdown of some key aspects of his thought:

**The Reconciliation of Old and New:** Coleridge argues for genius as the ability to see the familiar with fresh eyes. It's not about rejecting tradition but finding a way to experience the "Ancient of Days" (established truths) with the wonder of a child encountering something new for the first time.

**Preserving Childlike Wonder:** Genius, according to Coleridge, retains the "child's sense of wonder and novelty" throughout life. This ability to see the world with fresh curiosity allows for a deeper understanding and appreciation of the everyday.

**Art's Role in Reinvigorating Perception:** Coleridge emphasizes the artist's (here exemplified by Robert Burns) ability to "represent familiar objects" in a way that awakens a new perspective in the audience. This "freshness of sensation" is a crucial aspect of artistic merit.

**Genius and Philosophical Inquiry:** Just as in art, Coleridge sees genius as essential in philosophy. Genius can bring "novelty" to established truths, rescuing them from the "impotence" caused by their very familiarity.

**The Power of Forgotten Truths:** Coleridge warns against taking established truths for granted. Truths, even the most "awful and mysterious," can become dormant and lose their impact due to their very universality. Genius has the power to reawaken these truths and restore their power.

**The Paradoxical Nature of Truth:** Coleridge's concept of "extremes meeting" highlights the paradoxical nature of truth. The most fundamental truths, because of their familiarity, can become dormant and ineffective. This suggests a need for a constant process of rediscovery and re-evaluation.

**Coleridge's Depth as a Thinker:** This excerpt demonstrates Coleridge's ability to connect seemingly disparate ideas – childhood wonder, artistic expression, philosophical inquiry – into a cohesive framework. This ability to draw connections and see things from new perspectives is a hallmark of his philosophical depth.

In conclusion, Coleridge's concept of genius is not simply about originality or creating something entirely new. It's about a profound ability to see the world afresh, to find wonder in the familiar, and to breathe new life into established ideas. This perspective makes him a significant figure in both Romantic philosophy and literary criticism.

### Wordsworth and Coleridge 
While both Romantic poets, use distinct styles of language. Here's a quick comparison:

- **Wordsworth:**
    
    - Prefers **simple, everyday language**.
    - Often uses **descriptive** language to paint vivid pictures of nature.
    - Focuses on emotions like **awe, melancholy, and connection** with nature.
- **Coleridge:**
    
    - Employs a **more elevated and philosophical** vocabulary.
    - Uses **figurative language** like metaphors and similes more extensively.
    - Explores ideas like **imagination, genius, and the power of novelty**.

**Appreciation of the Passage:**

The selected passage from Lamb's "Imperfect Sympathies" showcases his signature style of familiar essay writing. Here's what makes it stand out:

- **Humor and Self-deprecation:** Lamb's humor shines through his playful exaggeration and self-mockery. He admits his "imperfect intellect" and inability to connect with "Scotchmen" (Scots).

- **Conversational Tone:** The writing feels like a friendly chat, with Lamb directly addressing the reader ("you") and employing informal language ("random word").

**General Principles of Lamb's "Familiar Essays":**

Based on the passage and the information provided, here are some general principles of Lamb's familiar essays:

- **Personal and Anecdotal:** Lamb often uses personal experiences and anecdotes as a springboard for his reflections.
- **Informal and Conversational:** He employs a relaxed and informal tone, mimicking the style of conversation.

**Overall, Charles Lamb's familiar essays are a delightful blend of humor, wit, and insightful observations. They offer a unique perspective on the world, delivered in a conversational and engaging style.**

**Note:** While the passage presents a humorous stereotype of Scotsmen, it's important to remember the broader context of Lamb's writing. His underlying purpose might be to celebrate intellectual diversity and the value of different ways of thinking.


### Defines a gentleman as courtesy, empathy, and self-control

John Henry Newman, in the selected text from "Discourse VIII," defines a gentleman through his actions and manners, emphasizing qualities like courtesy, empathy, and self-control. Here's a breakdown of Newman's perspective:

- **Pain Avoidance:** Newman claims it's almost a definition of a gentleman to "never inflict pain." This goes beyond mere politeness. A true gentleman actively seeks to remove obstacles and create a comfortable environment for those around him.
- **Social Harmony:** The ideal gentleman avoids causing "a jar or a jolt" in social interactions. He promotes harmony by avoiding conflict, suspicion, and negativity.
- **Consideration and Empathy:** Newman emphasizes a gentleman's attentiveness to others. He is "tender towards the bashful," "gentle towards the distant," and "merciful towards the absurd." This suggests a deep sense of empathy and social awareness.
- **Modesty and Humility:** A true gentleman is not "prominent in conversation" and avoids boasting. He downplays his own favors and seems like a gracious recipient when offering help.
- **Fairness and Self-Control:** Newman highlights the gentleman's fairness in arguments. He avoids "mean" tactics and doesn't hold grudges. He is patient, forbearing, and accepts what cannot be changed.
- **Intellectual Refinement:** Education plays a role in shaping a gentleman. A disciplined intellect allows him to be clearheaded, avoid "blundering discourtesy," and engage in constructive debate.
- **Understanding and Open-mindedness:** The ideal gentleman considers other viewpoints. He recognizes "the weakness of human reason" and shows "candour, consideration, and indulgence" towards those with differing opinions.

In essence, Newman's gentleman is more than just good manners. He embodies a combination of courtesy, empathy, self-control, and intellectual refinement. He creates a positive social environment and interacts with the world with fairness and understanding.

### The Madwoman in the Attic

**Main Conflicts:**

- **Jane vs. Societal Constraints:** Throughout the novel, Jane struggles against the limitations placed upon women in Victorian society. She fights for independence, education, and the right to define her own happiness. This clashes with expectations for women to be submissive and domestic.
- **Jane vs. Rochester:** Their love story is complicated by social class and Rochester's bigamy (his hidden marriage to Bertha). Jane grapples with reconciling her love for him with her self-respect and moral compass.
- **Bertha vs. Rochester:** Bertha embodies the consequences of societal oppression. Imprisoned for her "madness," she represents the potential fate for any woman who dares to rebel against expectations.

**Feminist Significance:**

- **Challenging Gender Roles:** Jane's journey pushes back against the ideal of the passive, angelic Victorian woman. She is intelligent, passionate, and prioritizes her own well-being.
- **The "Madwoman" as a Symbol:** Bertha's existence critiques the way society pathologizes and silences female nonconformity.
- **Marriage and Independence:** Jane's eventual marriage to Rochester, on her own terms, suggests a potential path for women to find happiness within marriage while maintaining some independence.

**Note:** There are also interpretations that view Jane's happy ending as a compromise, suggesting true female liberation remains elusive in Victorian society.
