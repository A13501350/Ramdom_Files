John Dryden (1631-1700) was a literary giant of his age. He was an English poet, literary critic, translator, and playwright. He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. 

Dryden dominated the literary life of Restoration England, so the period can be called the "Age of Dryden". He wrote many poems and plays, including several rhymed heroic plays that considerably reveal his interest in philosophical and political issues of his time. 

He became poet laureate in 1668. Aside from being a poet and playwright, Dryden is also known as a great satirist. His Absalom and Achitophel (1681)**《押沙龙与阿齐托菲尔》** is a celebrated satire in the history of English prose. He is also remembered for his translation of the greatest Latin epic, The Aeneid of Virgil **维吉尔的《埃涅阿斯纪》**. 

Among Dryden's voluminous poetic, dramatic and prose works, he is best remembered for his critical view of the literature demonstrated in his An Essay of Dramatic Poesy (1668)**《论戏剧诗》**. In a lucid prose style, Dryden defends in the book his literary practice **by presenting his various viewpoints in dialogue form**. 

T. S. Eliot, the famous modernist, once said, "he (Dryden) was one famous poet-playwright-critic assessing another famous poet-playwright-critic."  

  

The following passage is from Dryden's A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire (1693)**《论讽刺艺术的起源与演变》**. It can be read as an excellent example of Dryden's literary definition of satire that he liked to use in his mock epics. The passage here is part of his preface to his allegorical poem Absalom and Achitophel《押沙龙与阿齐托菲尔》. Such prologues and epilogues, attached to his dramas and those of his contemporaries, are among the highest achievements in English prose. 

Mindful students of English Literature may also find in this passage a tincture of Dryden's neo-classical style that canbe defined as "**the use of smooth metre, rhyming couplets, epic diction, balanced clauses, biting satire, and an inclination to moralize with sentences**".

  

【Selected Tex】

_**What Is a Satirist's Task?**_

How easy is it to call rogue and villain, and that wittily1! But how hard to make a manappear a fool, a blockhead, or a knave without using any of those opprobrious2 terms!直截了当地骂某某人是泼皮无赖很容易，即便要做到骂人骂得巧妙也不难。然而，如果不用任何骂人的字眼就达到骂人的目的，让被骂的人显出傻瓜、蠢材或坏人之象，那可就难上加难了。To sparethe grossness of the names, and to do the thing3 yet more severely, is to draw a full face, and to make the nose and cheeks stand out, and yet not to employ any depth of shadowing. This is the mystery of that noble trade4, which yet no master can teach to his apprentice; he may give the rules, but the scholar5 is never the nearer in his practice. Neither is it true that this fineness of raillery is offensive. A witty man is tickled while he is hurt in this manner, and a fool feels it not. The occasion of an offense may possibly be given, but he cannot take it. If it be granted that ineffect this way does more mischief; that a man is secretly wounded, and though he be not sensible himself, yet the malicious world6 will find it out for him: yet there is still a vast difference betwixt7 the slovenly butchering of a man, and the fineness of a stroke that separates the head from the body, and leaves it standing in its place.杀人可以胡乱砍杀，也可手起刀落，人头落地而身躯不倒；前者迟滞拖沓，后者堪称技艺精湛。两者之间有着天壤之别。A man may be capable, as Jack Ketch8's wife said of his servant, of a plain piece of work9, a bare hanging; but to make a malefactor dies weetly10 was only belonging to her husband. I wish I could apply it to myself, if the reader would be kind enough to think it belongs to me. The character of Zimri in my Absalom11 is, in my opinion, worth the whole poem: it is not bloody, but it is ridiculous enough; and he, for whom it was intended, was too wity to resent it as an injury. If I had railed, I might have suffered for it justly; but I managed my own work more happily, perhaps more dexterously. I avoided the mention of great crimes, and applied myself to the representing of blindsides, and little extravagancies; to which, the witier a man is, he is generaly the more obnoxious12. It succeeded as I wished; the jest went round, and he was laughed at in his turn who began the frolic.我达到了预期的目的；诗中轻松的调笑打趣比比皆是，最先嘲弄他人的人，经过一番嬉笑怒骂，却轮到自己处境尴尬，贻笑大方。

## 讽刺作家的任务

直接称某人为恶棍或流氓，就算要做到巧妙地辱骂也轻而易举。难的是不用任何恶意的字眼，却让人显出愚蠢、迟钝或卑鄙的嘴脸。要避免粗鄙的谩骂，却比直接谩骂更加辛辣到位，就如同画一幅完整的脸，让鼻子和脸颊凸显出来，却不用深重的阴影刻画。这就是那高贵技艺的奥秘所在，然而却不是师父能直接传授给徒弟的。师傅可以讲解规则，但徒弟光靠死记硬背并不能真正掌握实践技巧。

这种巧妙的嘲弄也并非真的让人感到冒犯。聪明人即便被冒犯到，也会为这种巧妙的技艺而莞尔。而愚蠢的人则根本察觉不到其中的讽刺意味。顶多只是提供了冒犯的理由，他们也无法真正领会。或许有人认为这种方式会造成更大的伤害，即使受害人自己没有意识到，恶意的人们也会替他发觉。然而，这和笨拙的屠夫胡乱砍杀相比，两者之间还是有天壤之别。一个熟练的刽子手只需一刀，就能将人头砍下，身体却依然站立着。粗暴和精巧之间的差异显而易见。

就好像杰克·凯奇妻子的仆人，他只擅长做简单的绞刑这种粗活。而让罪犯“甜蜜地死去”则是她丈夫独有的本领。真希望读者能认为我也具备这种本领。在我看来，诗歌《押沙龙》中塑造的 Zimri 这个角色，比整部诗歌都精彩。他并非血腥暴力的形象，却足够可笑；而作为讽刺对象的那个聪明人，也意识到了这一点，但他并不会因此而感到受伤。如果我直接谩骂，或许会遭到应有的惩罚。但我巧妙地运用了这种手法，避免提及重大罪行，而是着眼于那些盲点和轻微的过失。一般来说，越聪明的人，就越容易在这方面露出破绽。我的目的达到了，轻松的调侃在人们之间传颂，最初嘲弄他人的那个人，最终沦为了笑柄。
