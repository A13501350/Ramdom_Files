Francis Bacon 弗兰西斯·培根 (1561年1月22日-1626年4月9日)，英国文艺复兴时期代表人物之一，英国唯物主义哲学家，实验科学的创始人，是近代归纳法的创始人，又是给科学研究程序进行逻辑组织化的先驱。培根也是英国历史上最重要的散文家。主要著作有**《新工具》****《论科学的增进》**以及**《学术的伟大复兴》**等。

[培根出生于伦敦一个新贵族家庭](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247489194&idx=1&sn=c1f3a3f9dec9259c9abf53c8a7aa124b&chksm=c2a32b05f5d4a21397254d8395baa571822a4faa46f1cc64bd485cb96dd5cbae7ae1f980bcfd&scene=21#wechat_redirect)，12岁入剑桥大学三一学院深造，大学中的学习使他对传统观念和信仰产生了怀疑，开始独自思考社会和人生的真谛。三年后，培根作为英国驻法大使的随员旅居法国巴黎。短短两年半的时间里，他几乎走遍了整个法国，这使他接触到不少新的事物，汲取了许多新的思想，并且对其世界观的转变产生了极大的影响。

1582年，21岁的培根取得了律师资格。1584年，23岁的他当选为国会议员。先后担任女王特别法律顾问以及朝廷的首席检察官、掌玺大臣等。

1602年，伊丽莎白去世，詹姆士一世继位。由于培根曾力主苏格兰与英格兰的合并，受到詹姆士的大力赞赏。培根因此平步青云，扶摇直上。1602年受封为爵士，1604年被任命为詹姆士的顾问，1607年被任命为副检察长，1613年被委任为首席检察官，1616年，被任命为枢密院顾问，1617年提升为掌玺大臣，1618年晋升为英格兰的大陆官，授封为维鲁兰男爵，1621年又授封为奥尔本斯子爵。但培根的才能和志趣不在国务活动上，而存在于对科学真理的探求上。这一时期，他在学术研究上取得了巨大的成果。并出版了多部著作。

1621年，培根被国会指控贪污受贿，被高级法庭判处罚金四万英镑，监禁于伦敦塔内，终生逐出宫廷，不得任议员和官职，脱离政治生涯。从此培根不再理政事，专心从事学术研究和著述活动，写成了一批在近代文学思想史上具有重大影响的著作，其中最重要的一部是**《伟大的复兴新工具论》**。另外，他以哲学家的眼光，思考了广泛的人生问题，写出了许多形式短小、风格活泼的随笔小品，集成**《培根随笔》**。

1626年3月底，培根由于身体孱弱，在实验中遭受风寒，支气管炎复发，病情恶化。1626年4月9日清晨病逝。

Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was an English philosopher, statesman and writer. As a statesman and lawyer, he used the scientific method to organize his empirical thinking. According to him, **knowledge can be divided into three groups: history, poetry, and philosophy**, which **must be studied through memory, imagination, and reason**. He helped **create the scientific method of strict observation and inductive reasoning**. 

Out of office, Bacon devoted himself entirely to writing, producing such works as À History of the Life and Reign of King Henry VII (1622)**《亨利七世的治理史及其他作品选》**, a Latin expansion of The Advancement of Learning, Essays (1625)**《论学术的发展和价值》**, and the posthumously published New Atlantis (1627)**《新大西岛》**. 

Bacon's Essays is widely admired for its **worldly wisdom** and has become a classic. He wrote **in clear prose, often employing paralleled sentence structures and aphorisms** to make a point concisely clear. For these merits, his Essays was highly esteemed by his contemporaries and continues to be held in high regard by modern readers and scholars.

  

Below are two excerpts from Bacon's Essays**《论说文集》**. 

The first is from "**Of Parents and Children**"《论父母与子女》. It provides the reader with some suggestions on **how parents may raise children and what relationship they should maintain with each other**. Bacon uses short and forceful assertions to express his view. Some views expressed in this passage may invite disagreement, such as when the author says parents should select a profession for their children. But in the main, he demonstrates what is goingon in reality. The essay has a relational and common subject matter. Here in this passage Bacon speaks like a teacher, and every parent can learn something from him.

The other excerpt is from "**Of Marriage and Single Life**"《论结婚与单身》. Bacon shows his readers **the advantages and disadvantages of having a family**. With an easeful prose style marked by some contrastive ideas expressed in short sentences, Bacon builds up his aphoristic or proverbial advice. Many Chinese students may be impressed by Bacon's famous aphorisms such as "reading makes a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man"(from "[**Of Study**](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247489194&idx=1&sn=c1f3a3f9dec9259c9abf53c8a7aa124b&chksm=c2a32b05f5d4a21397254d8395baa571822a4faa46f1cc64bd485cb96dd5cbae7ae1f980bcfd&scene=21#wechat_redirect)"). Similarly, they will find some in this selection. But one must always be aware of the fact that ideas change over time. What Bacon advises on marriage and single life may not appeal to the young people of modern life. Yet modern readers may find some if Bacon's thoughts on this issue sympathetic. For instance, you may agree with Bacon when he says, "Wives are young men's mistresses, companions for middle age, and old men's nurses."

  

【Selected Text】 

**Of Parents and Children** (An Excerpt) 

The joys of parents are secret, and so are their griefs and fears; they cannot utter the one, nor they will not utter the other.为人父母者，其欢乐不显于外，其哀伤与担忧亦隐忍于内。他们喜而不形于色，哀而不言伤，忧而不说愁。Children sweeten labours1, but they make misfortunes more bitter; they increase the cares of life, but they mitigate the remembrance of death. The perpetuity by generation2 is common to beasts; but memory, merit, and noble works, are proper to men: and surely a man shall see the noblest works and foundations3 have proceeded from childless men, which have sought to express the images of their minds where those of their bodies have failed; so the care of posterity is most in them that have no posterity. They that are the first raisers4 of their houses are most indulgent towards their children, beholding them as the continuance, not only of their kind, but of their work故曰：无后代者更为后代子孙着想。养家糊口的当家人对儿女也最为纵容。在他们看来，子女不仅使家族得以延续传承，也使自己的事业后继有人; and so both children and creatures.

The difference in affection of parents towards their several children is many times unequal, and sometimes unworthy, especially in the mother; as Solomon saith5, "A wise son rejoices the father, but an ungracious son shames the mother." A man shall see, where there is a house full of children, one or two of the eldest respected, and the youngest made wantons; but in the midst some that are, as it were, forgotten, who many times, nevertheless, prove the best. The illiberality of parents6, in allowance towards their children, is a harmful error, makes them base, acquaints them with shifts, makes them sort with7 mean company, and makes them surfeit8 more when they come to plenty; and, therefore, the proof is best when men keep their authority towards their children, but not their purse. Men have a foolish manner (both parents, and schoolmasters, and servants), in creating and breeding an emulation between brothers during childhood, which many times sorteth9 to discord when they are men, and disturbeth10 families. .. Let parents choose betimes11 the vocations and courses they mean their children should take, for then they are most flexible; and let them not too much apply themselves to the disposition of their children, as thinking they will take best to that which they have most mind to. It is true, that if the affection or aptness of the children be extraordinary, then it is good not to cross it; but generally the precept is good, "Optimum elige, suave et facile illud faciet consuetudo12."—Younger brothers are commonly fortunate, but seldom or never where the elder are disinherited.

**Of Marriage and Single Life** (An Excerpt) 

He that hath1 wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief. 男人一旦娶妻生子，即做了命运的人质，从此为妻儿所累，难成大事，无论大善还是大恶。Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for

the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men, which, both in affection and means, have married and endowed2 the public. Yet it were great reason that those that havechildren should have greatest care of future times, unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges3. Some there are who, though they lead a single life, yet their thoughts do end with themselves, and account future times impertinences4; nay, there are some other that account wife and children but as bills of charges; nay more, there are some foolish, rich, covetous men, that take a pride in having no children, because they may be thought so much the richer; for, perhaps they have heard some talk, "Such an one is a great rich man," and another except to it5, "Yea, but he hath a great charge of children6;" as if it were an abatement to his riches. But the most ordinary cause of a single life is liberty, especially in certain self-pleasing and humorous minds, which are so sensible of every restraint, as they will go near to think7 their girdles and garters to be bonds and shackles. Unmarried men are best friends, best masters, best servants; but not always best subjects, for they are light to8 run away独身者是最好的朋友、最好的主人、最好的仆人，却未必是最好的臣民，因为他们无牵无挂，容易脱身, and almost all fugitives are of that condition.... Chaste women are often proud and froward9, as presuming upon the merit of their chastity. It is one of the best bonds, both of chastity and obedience, in the wife, if she think her husband wise, which she will never do if she finds him jealous. Wives are young men's mistresses, companions for middle age, and old men's nurses, so as a man may have a quarrel10 to marry when he will; but yet he was reputed one of the wise men that made answer to the question when a man should marry, "A young man not yet, an elder man not at all," It is often seen that bad husbands have very good wives; whether it be that it raiseth the price of theirhusbands'kindness when it comes11, or that the wives take a pride in their patience; but this never fails, if the bad husbands were of their own choosing, against their friends' consent, fir then they will be sure to make good12 their own folly.

拥有妻子儿女的人犹如将自己作为命运的人质，因为他们无论想要成就伟大的善行还是恶行，都会因妻儿而受到阻碍。的确，对公众最有利、最杰出的作品往往出自未婚或无子女之人，他们将情感和资源都奉献给了公众事业。然而，有子女的人更应该关心未来，因为他们知道自己要将最珍贵的宝物传承下去。有些人虽独身一人，但他们的思想只局限于自己，认为未来与己无关；还有些人将妻子儿女视为累赘的负担；更有一些愚蠢、富有、贪婪之人因不想有孩子而沾沾自喜，以为这样显得更加富有。他们或许听过别人夸赞某人“非常富有”，另一人则补充道“是的，但他也有很多孩子需要抚养”，仿佛孩子是财富的减损。然而，选择单身最普遍的原因是追求自由，尤其是一些喜欢独处、性格古怪的人，他们对任何束缚都极其敏感，甚至会觉得腰带和袜套都是枷锁和桎梏。未婚男子可以成为最好的朋友、主人和仆人，却未必成为最好的臣民，因为他们没有牵挂，容易逃离，而逃亡者大多是这类人。……贞洁的女性往往骄傲任性，自以为贞洁是值得炫耀的优点。妻子认为丈夫睿智，这会成为夫妻双方保持贞洁和服从的最重要纽带之一，可如果妻子发现丈夫嫉妒心强，她就永远不会这么想了。妻子是年轻人的情人、中年人的伴侣、老人的护士，因此男人任何时候都可以找到结婚的理由；然而，一位智者曾回答过这样一个问题：“男人什么时候应该结婚？”他的回答是“年轻时不要结婚，年老时更不要结婚。” 经常可以看到坏丈夫却拥有好妻子，这可能是因为丈夫的善意难能可贵，又或许是妻子以自己的忍耐为荣；但有一点永远不会错，那就是如果妻子是自己违背朋友劝告选择的糟糕丈夫，她们一定会尽力弥补自己的愚蠢行为。
