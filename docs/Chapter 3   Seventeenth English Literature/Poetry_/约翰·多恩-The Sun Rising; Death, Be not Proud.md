**John Donne** **约翰·多恩** (也译作**约翰·邓恩/约翰·道恩**，1572年1月22日—1631年3月31日)， 出身于天主教家庭，曾就读于牛津和剑桥两所学校，但由于当时他拒绝皈依英国国教，未获任何学位。

十七世纪英国**玄学派**诗人、教士，被T·S艾略特推崇，布罗茨基和这位久远年代的异国诗人，曾在欧洲大陆游历，也曾是宫廷中潇洒倜傥、前途无量的绅士。

1598年，约翰·邓恩被任命为[**伊丽莎白**](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247507834&idx=1&sn=aa7375fec4e12eb886c85de0e2fdccf9&chksm=c2a0e2d5f5d76bc3f79367f1d55d9e735b62dff777bdc8550f5f76ef2c0789c53d39b0e98cba&scene=21#wechat_redirect)宫廷中最重要的一位爵士的私人秘书。他的仕途似乎一片光明。邓恩也能够逢迎那些达官贵人。但是1601年，他的人生出现了重大转折。他与一位17岁少女秘密结婚，由此毁了自己的大好仕途。

伊丽莎白时代的诗歌大多讲究雕饰，意象华丽。邓恩通过使用一种**更注重智力的比喻，激情与推理融为一体**，而给诗歌重新注入了活力。他创造了极为凝炼意象，这些意象通常包含着一种戏剧性对比的因素。他在诗中嘲笑传统的爱情诗的陈词滥调。邓恩不仅在意象和观念上作大胆的实验，而且在诗的节奏和诗节形式也作创新。**本.琼生**曾经说到：“邓恩在很多方面是世界上第一诗人。”

  

John Donne (1572-1631) was educated at home by Catholic tutors before studying at the age of 11 at Hart Hall, Oxford. He travelled extensively on the Continent before he came to settle in London. In 1621, Donne procured the deanery at St. Paul, a position to deliver sermons. About 160 of Donne's sermons survive. In 1633, the first collected edition of Donne's verse was published. 

Donne's work greatly influenced other seventeenth-century poets such as **George Herbert**, Richard Crashaw, Henry Vaughan, Andrew Marvell, and Abraham Cowley. These poets were known as the "**metaphysical**"玄学派 school of poets (a term coined by **John Dryden** and Samuel Johnson), for they practised Donne's **vigorous, conversational, and wittily "conceited" style, which is characterized by the use of realistic, homely imagery, a concentration of thought, and a precision of diction**. 

Donne's sermons and poetry are **death-obsessed**. Many of his letters and prose works were **haunted by the theme of mortality and time**. He once wrote that he had a "sickly inclination" and he had pondered suicide. As he puts in another poem, "I...am the grave / Of all that's nothing." But from another perspective, readers of John Donne may realize that **the poet is thinking hard about the relationship between his selfhood and existence itself**. 

With Sir Herbert Grierson's edition of Donne's poetry in 1921, Donne's influence was revived in the twentieth century poets struggling to find truth and meaning in a rapidly changing world. For these poets, Donne provided a fitting model to follow.

  

Presented below are two poems by John Donne. 

The first one, "**The Sun Rising**"**《太阳升起》**, seldom misses the attention of any anthologist of English poetry. It is among **the most appealing metaphysical love poems by John Donne**. 

With **extensive hyperbole**, the poet asserts **the absolute value of love and the sacredness of mutual love** **in the earthly world**. With **metaphysical conceits**, these assertions create figuratively a state of feeling: to lovers in bed, the rising sun seems like an intruder, having nothing to do with a love affair, and the bedroom is the world itself unrelated to the world where the sun is the centre. Some critics have rightly said that **the inspiration of this poem is to pretend that each of these states of feeling represents a metaphysical truth**. In form, the poem follows a regular rhyme scheme, but its line metres vary through its three stanzas. 

The second poem in this selection, "**Death, Be not Proud**"**《****死神，别骄傲》**, is the tenth poem in Donne's nineteen Holy Sonnets. Through personification and rhetorical declaration, the poet deconstructs **the dreadful image of death and finds comfort in the earthly world**. In this poem, **a synthesis of reason and passion is achieved**, for the realistic claim "All men must die" is dissolved in the sensational pleasure in rest and sleep, and in the freedom of soul after death.

  

  

The Sun Rising ,Christopher Hassall

【Selected Text】

The Sun Rising

Busy old fool, unruly Sun,

Why dost thou thus,

Through windows, and through curtains, call on us?

Must to thy motions1 lovers' seasons run?

Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide

Late school-boys and sour prentices2,

Go tell court-huntsmen that the king3 wil ride,

Call country ants4 to harvest offices5;

Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime6,

Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time7.

  

Thy beams so reverend, and strong

Why shouldst thou think?

I could eclipse8 and cloud them with a wink,

But that I would not lose her sight so long.

If her eyes have not blinded thine,

Look, and to-morrow late tell me,

Whether both th' Indias9 of spice and mine

Be where thou left'st them, or lie here with me.

Ask for those kings10 whom thou saw'st yesterday,

And thou shalt hear, "All here in one bed lay."

  

She's all states, and all princes, I,

Nothing else is.

Princes do but play us; compared to this,

All honour's mimic, all wealth alchemy11

Thou, Sun, art half as happy as we,

In that the world's contracted thus;

Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be

To warm the world, that's done in warming us.

Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;

This bed thy centre is, these walls thy sphere.

Death be not Proud,Richard Burton

【Selected Text】

_Death, Be not Proud_

Death, be not proud, though some have called thee

Mighty and dreadful, for thou art1 not so;

For those whom thou think'st thou dost2 overthrow

Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.

From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be3,

Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,

And soonest our best men with thee do go,

Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery4.

Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,

And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,

And poppy or charms5 can make us sleep as well

And better than thy stroke6; why swell'st7 thou then?

One short sleep past, we wake eternally

And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.

【Notes】

死神，别骄傲，虽有人把你称作
可怕的巨灵，其实你并非如此，
那些你以为击倒的人们，并没死，
可怜的死神，你也不可能杀死我。
说休息和睡眠是你的写照，那么，
你一定会给人付出更多的欣喜，
所以精英们急急忙忙跟你去，
让尸骨安息，让灵魂得到解脱。
是命运、帝王、强徒的奴仆，
你又跟鸩毒、战争、疫病为伍，
可鸦片、巫术也能使我们睡眠，
还睡得更好，你何必如此傲慢？
我们匆匆睡一觉，便醒于永恒，
不再有死亡，死的该是你，死神！
