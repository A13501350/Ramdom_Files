**John Milton** (1608-1674) was a world-renowned English poet and powerful writer on political, religious and moral issues. He was educated at St Paul's School, Cambridge, obtaining his BA in 1629 and MA in 1632. Milton was a voracious learner. If Shakespeare's genius seems to comefrom nature, **Milton's talents were developed through exhaustive study**. 

As a boy, he read by candlelight past midnight and continued his devotion to study throughout his life, even after he was totally blind. **Milton is considered** **one of the forefathers of the English literature of later ages**. 

His epic poem _**Paradise Lost**_ (1667)**《失乐园》**, though a reflection of the failure of the Commonwealth period that he supported so ardently, has succeeded in giving rise to two centuries of English poetry. 

Throughout his life, **he had strong opinions about government, religion, education, and society, and his pamphlet campaigns on these matters** led to his incarceration and nearly cost him his life. And he wrote ardently about these issues, producing enduring tracts such as **_The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce_** (1643)**《论婚姻的道义与原则》**, _**Of Education**_ (1644)**《论教育》**, _**Areopagitica**_ (1644)**《论出版自由》**, _**A Defence of the English People**_ (1651)**《为英国人民声辩》**, _**The Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth**_ (1660)**《建设自由共和国的简易办法》**, _**A Treatise of Civil Power**_ (1659)**《公民权力论》**and many others. 

**Milton's influence on English literature is inestimable. His achievements are monumental; his greatest works mark the culmination of ancient traditions, and it has been claimed by some literary critics that much later literature is a series of footnotes to Milton**.

Aside from the mighty lines of classical sonority presented in his great Paradise Lost and other works, Milton also published his collection of poems on various themes. Below are two poems by Milton. 

The first one, "On Time"**《论时间》**, is among his most-read poems. Milton personifies time in this poem, dealing with one of the most common themes in [medieval or Renaissance literature](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247485589&idx=1&sn=7ebd0386291cfd40dd89c810c25c628a&chksm=c2a3353af5d4bc2ccea07e1efea60b87ee8a493e44a47aa8df9bfd9b23fb8cc0c6702554a08f&scene=21#wechat_redirect): the theme of mutability, or the idea that life on earth is full of constant (mainly negative) change. The poet describes time as **the one element of human existence which must be dismissed for a genuinely timeless world to exist**. 

The poet begins this piece by directing his words to "Time", asking it to get out of the way quickly. **This entity is the one that he believes is the cause of human suffering in this world**. He wishes that it would speed up, eat up all the worldly falsities and vanities and then destroy itself to make way for divine and eternal tranquillity for humankind. **In a world without Time, there would be no need for vain wants or desires, and all people would find etermal life**. 

The other poem, a famous sonnet by Milton, expresses the poet's determination to continue his work despite personal calamity. In the 1640s, Milton began to lose his eyesight gradually as a result of his heavy workload. By the year 1652, Milton, at the age of 44, went in tototal blindness. What a terrible fate he had run into! The sense most precious to his art (writing) was taken away from him. 

In "On His Blindness"**《哀失明》**, Milton struggles to understand what God expects of him now that he is losing sight. He's upset about wasting "that one Talent which isdeath to hide". He mildly complains that he cannot do day's labour in darkness. Then **he grows patient as Patience, personified here as a living person, interjects his thoughts and softly reminds him that God does not need Milton to do anything.** Patience tells him that the best way to serve God is just **to accept life for what it is since this is God's will**. Milton is also reminded that God has plenty of people to run around and carry out his errands. More importantly, Milton should wait patiently and trust that God will know the best way to use him, and his blindness.

【Selected Text】

On Time

Fly envious Time, till thou run out thy race,      飞驰而去吧，

Call on the lazy leaden-stepping1 hours,           不怀好意的时间

Whose speed is but the heavy Plummets pace; 快快结束你流程！

And glut thy self with what thy womb devours,

Which is no more then what is false and vain,

And meerly2 mortal dross;

So little is our loss,

So little is thy gain.

For when as each thing bad thou hastentomb'd3,

And last of all, thy greedy self consum'd4,

Then long Eternity shall greet our bliss

With an individual kiss5;

And Joy shall overtake us as a flood,

When every thing that is sincerely good

And perfectly divine,

With Truth, and Peace, and Love shall ever shine

About the supreme Throne

Of him, t'whose happy-making sight alone,

When once our heav'nly-guided soul shall clime6,

Then all this Earthy grosnes7 quit,

Attir'd with8 Stars, we shal for ever sit,

Triumphing over Death, and Chance, and thee O Time.

The Great Poets: Sonnet: On his Blindness,Derek Jacobi

【Selected Text】

On His Blindness

When I consider how my light1 is spent,

Ere2 half my days, in this dark world and wide,

And that one Talent3 which is death to hide

Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent

To serve therewith my Maker, and present

My true account, least he returning chide;

"Doth God exact4 day-labour, light denied?"

I fondly5 ask. But patience, to prevent

That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need

Either man's work or his own gifts; who best

Bear his mild yoke6, they serve him best. His state

Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding7 speed

And post o'er Land and Ocean without rest:

They also serve who only stand and wait8."  
**【Notes】**

1. light: eyesight; life; power of knowledge

2. ere: (old form of) before 

3. Talent: wisdom, mental capacity for creation; "Talent" originally means "money". The Bible tells the parable of the talents (Matthew 25: 14-30), in which two servants invest their talents while another just hides his talent in a hole and is punished by his master. **The poet is saying that he is the servant to God, his master, and will present his account for His inspection.** 

4. exact: force to do 

5. fondly: foolishly 

6. mild yoke: an allusion to the Bible: "My yoke is easy, my burden is light"(Matthew 11: 30). Jewish people were required to follow over 600 strict religious laws. **Jesus used this metaphor to relieve Jewish people of the burden of these laws.** 

7. bidding: order; instruction 

8. **They also serve who only stand and wait: Those who only stand and wait also serve God.**

## 论时间

**飞驰而去吧，** **不怀好意的时间，** 
**快快结束你流程！** 
**叫上蹒跚的钟点，** 
**铅锤般步履沉沉，** **一起飞走吧。**

**你吞噬的只是虚假和浮华，** 
**不过是尘世凡俗的糟粕，**
**我们的损失微乎其微，**
**你的收获也寥寥无几。**

**当你把所有罪恶埋葬，** 
**最终也将自己吞噬，** 
**永恒的时光将迎接我们的幸福，** 
**为我们送上亲密无间的吻。**

**欢乐像潮水注入我们全身，**
**一切真诚美好、**
**完美神圣的事物，**
**将与真理、和平和爱一起，** 
**永远闪耀在至高无上的宝座周围。**

**只有当我们灵魂升入天国，** 
**才能仰望造物主的圣颜，**
**抛却尘世的粗鄙，**
**披星戴月，永享安宁，** 
**战胜死亡、偶然和你，**
**哦，时间！**

### 哀失明
我这样考虑到：未及半生，就已然
在黑暗广大的世界里失去了光明，
同时那不运用就等于死亡的才能
对我已无用，纵然我灵魂更愿
用它来侍奉造我的上帝，并奉献
我的真心，否则他回首斥训——
于是我呆问：“上帝不给光，却要人
在白天工作？”——可是忍耐来阻拦
这怨言，答道：“上帝不强迫人做工，
也不收回赐予；谁最能接受
他温和的约束，谁就侍奉得最好；
他威灵显赫，命千万天使飞跑，
奔过陆地和海洋，不稍停留——
只站着待命的人，也是在侍奉。”
