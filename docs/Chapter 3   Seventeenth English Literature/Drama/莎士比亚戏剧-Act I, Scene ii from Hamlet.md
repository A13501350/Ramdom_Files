Among the treasure bank of this creation are **the great tragedies** such as 

Hamlet (1603)**《哈姆雷特》**, 

King Lear (1608)**《李尔王》**, 

Othello (1622)**《奥赛罗》**and 

Macbeth (1623)**《麦克白》**

[They have some characteristics in common. **Each portrays some noble hero**, who faces the injustice of human life and is caught in a difficult situation and whose fate is closely connected with the fate of the whole nation.](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247489150&idx=1&sn=963c19761446ba10332d24c31ed7e1be&chksm=c2a32bd1f5d4a2c7759e17c873927714f0ff26873f56476f8cbc8d30c163bf6cbc2ee6569ae8&scene=21#wechat_redirect) 

**Each hero has his weakness of nature**: 

**Hamlet,** the melancholic schola-prince, faces the dilemma between action and mind; 

**Othello's** inner weakness is made use of by the outside evil force; 

**the old king Lear** who is unwilling to totally give up his power makes himself suffer from treachery and infidelity; and 

**Macbeth****'s** lust for power stirs up his ambition leads him to incessant crimes. 每个英雄有都有自己性格上的弱点：**哈姆雷特**，一个忧郁的学者型王子，在采取行动与深思熟虑之间进退两难；**奥赛罗**内心的弱点则被外界的邪恶力量所利用；**李尔王**不愿将王位拱手相让，却使自己陷入亲人的背叛与不忠之中；而**麦克白**的无尽权欲扩张着他的野心，将他引入接连不断的罪恶行为。


Presented in the following is Act I, Scene ii of Shakespeare's great tragedy Hamlet. In the previous scene, Hamlet's close friend, Horatio, together with two sentinels, sees the apparition of Hamlet's dead father. 

The next morning, Hamlet's uncle Claudius, now the new king, addresses his Council, accompanied by his new wife, Gertrude. With his highly polished rhetoric, Claudius attempts to smooth over the major changes recently occurring in the royal family. After the formality is shown and the state business is dispatched, he asks Hamlet to stay in the court, to which Hamlet reluctantly agrees. This starts the plot of a tragedy. 

When everyone else exits, Hamlet presents his first soliloquy. He laments the sudden death of his father, cursing that he is not allowed by the divine power to suicide. He expresses his bitterness that his mother so hastily marries his uncle, exclaiming, "Frailty, thy name is woman".脆弱啊，你的名字是女人！Hamlet's lamentable an choleric monologue is then interrupted by the arrival of Horatio and the two sentinels, who have come to tell him about King Hamlet's ghost. Surprised, Hamlet agrees to try to meet the spirit later that night. 

This scene is crucial for students to understand the whole play. It sets up one of many themes of the play; namely, **appearance is deceptive, and reality is revealed by unveiling such an outward show**. 

**Hamlet demonstrates a remarkable sensitivity to false appearances in this scene**. He assures his mother that outward displays of sorrow, such as weeping, sighing, or wearing black, are a mere performance of grief that may or may not match what one truly feels inside. **The prince's sensitivity to shows in reality partly explains his delay in taking action against a "sea of troubles" of existence and his revenge against the king, his uncle**.

**Act I Scene ii**

(An Excerpt)

**KING**. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

The memory be green1, and that it us befitted

To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom

To be contracted2 in one brow of woe;

Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature  

That we with wisest sorrow think on him,

Together with remembrance of ourselves.

不过，理智与感情一直争斗，

我们以最理性方式寄托哀思

同时也切不可忘记我们自己。

Therefore our sometime3 sister, now our queen,

Th'imperial jointress4 to this warlike state,

Have we, as 'twere5 with a defeated joy,

With one auspicious and one dropping eye,

With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,

In equal scale weighing delight and dole6,

Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd7

Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone

With this affair along. For all, our thanks.

Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras,

Holding a weak supposal8 of our worth,

Or thinking by our late dear brother's death

Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,

Colleagued with9 this dream of his advantage,

He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,

Importing10 the surrender of those lands

Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,

To our most valiant brother. So much for him.

Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:

Thus much the business is: we have here writ

To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,

Who, impotent and bed-rid11, scarcely hears

Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress

His further gait12 herein; in that the levies,

The lists, and full proportions are all made

Out of his subject: and we here dispatch

You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,

For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,

Giving to you no further personal power

To business with the King, more than the scope

Of these dilated articles13 allow.

Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty14.  
**CORNELIUS** and **VOLTEMAND**. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.

**KING.**We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

[Exeunt VOLTEMAND and CORNELIUS.]

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?

You told us of some suit15. What is't, Laertes?

You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,

And lose your voice16. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,

That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?

The head is not more native17 to the heart,

The hand more instrumental18 to the mouth,

Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.

What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

**LAERTES.** Dread my lord,

Your leave19 and favour to return to France,

From whence though willingly I came to Denmark

To show my duty in your coronation;

Yet now I must confess, that duty done,

My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,

And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

**KING.** Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

**POLONIUS.** He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave

By laboursome petition; and at last

Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.

I do beseech you give him leave to go.

**KING.** Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,

And thy best graces20 spend it at thy will!

But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-  
**HAMLET** (aside). A little more than kin, and less than kind.亲族关系少许近，心存隔膜情愈远。  
**KING.** How is it that the clouds still hang on you?**为什么愁云依旧笼罩在你的身上？**  
**HAMLET.** Not so, my lord, I am too much in the sun.  
**QUEEN.** Good Hamlet, cast thy nightly colour21 off,

And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.

Do not for ever with thy veiled lids22

Seek for thy noble father in the dust.

Thou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die,  

Passing through nature to eternity.

你知道，这事很普通，人人皆会死去，

过完一生，走进永恒之境界。

**HAMLET.** Ay, madam, it is common.  
**QUEEN.** If it be,

Why seems it so particular with thee?

**HAMLET.** Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.

'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

Nor customary23 suits of solemn black,

Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath24,

No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,

Nor the dejected haviour of the visage25,

Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,

That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,

For they are actions that a man might play;

But I have that within which passeth26 show;

These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

**它们不过是悲哀的装饰和衣服；可是我郁结的心事却无法表现出来。**

**KING.** 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,

To give these mourning duties to your father;

But you must know, your father lost a father,

That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound

In filial obligation, for some term

To do obsequious27 sorrow. But to persevere

In obstinate condolement is a course

Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief,

It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,

A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,

An understanding simple and unschool'd28;

**然而固执不变的哀伤，**

**却是一种逆天悖理的愚行，**

**不是堂堂男子所应有的举动；**

**这哀伤表现出一种不肯安于天命的意志，**

**一颗经不起艰难痛苦的心，**

**一个缺少忍耐的头脑和一种简单愚昧的理性。**

For what we know must be, and is as common

As any the most vulgar thing to sense29,

Why should we in our peevish opposition

Take it to heart? Fie30, 'tis a fault to heaven,

A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,

To reason most absurd, whose common theme

Is death of fathers, and who still31 hath cried,

From the first corpse till he that died today,

'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth

This unprevailing32 woe, and think of us

As of a father; for let the world take note

You are the most immediate to our throne,

And with no less nobility of love

Than that which dearest father bears his son

**我请你抛弃了这种无益的悲伤，**

**把我当作你的父亲；**

**因为我要让全世界知道，**

**你是王位直接的继承者，**

**我要给你尊荣和恩宠，**

**不亚于一个最慈爱的父亲之于他的儿子。**

Do I impart toward you. For your intent

In going back to school in Wittenberg,

It is most retrograde33 to our desire:

And we beseech you bend you34 to remain

Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

**QUEEN.**Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.

I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

**HAMLET.** I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

**KING.** Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.

Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;

This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet

Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,

No jocund health that Denmark drinks today

But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,

And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,

Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

[Exeunt all but HAMLET.]

Hamlet, Act I: Scene II "O That This Too Too Solid Flesh . . .",Sir Laurence Olivier

**HAMLET.** O that this too too solid flesh would melt,

Thaw, and resolve35 itself into a dew!

Or that the Everlasting36 had not fix'd

His canon 'gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God!

How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable  

Seem to me all the uses37 of this world!

Fie on't! Oh fie! 'tis an unweeded garden  

That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature  

Possess it merely. That it should come to this!

在我看来，这人世间形形色色，

多么地陈腐而无聊，毫无价值！

厌烦！讨厌！这就是一座荒园，

长年无人打理而处处枝蔓横生，

尽长出些自生自灭的杂木劣草。

But two months dead--nay, not so much, not two:

So excellent a king; that was to this

Hyperion38 to a satyr39; so loving to my mother,

That he might not beteem40 the winds of heaven

Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!

Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him

As if increase of appetite had grown

By what it fed on; and yet, within a month  

Let me not think on't-Frailty, thy name is woman!

A little month, or ere41 those shoes were old

With which she followed my poor father's body

Like Niobe42, all tears.-Why she, even she

O God! A beast that wants43 discourse of reason

Would have mourn'd longer, -married with mine uncle,

……可是，不过就这么一个月的时间，

我不能再想下去了！脆弱啊，你的名字是女人！

就这短短的一个月！一个月前她为我父亲送葬，

哭得死去活来，比失去十四个孩子的希腊女神......

My father's brother; but no more like my father

Than I to Hercules44. Within a month?

Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

Had left the flushing in her galled45 eyes,

She married. O most wicked speed, to post

With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

It is not, nor it cannot come to good.

But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.

[Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.]

**HORATIO.** Hail to your lordship!

**HAMLET.** I am glad to see you well:

Horatio, or I do forget myself.

**HORATIO.** The same, my lord,

And your poor servant ever.

...

My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

**HAMLET.** Saw? Who?

**HORATIO.** My lord, the King your father.

**HAMLET.** The King my father!

**HORATIO.** Season your admiration for a while

With an attent ear, till I may deliver

Upon the witness of these gentlemen

This marvel to you.

**HAMLET.** For God's love let me hear.

I will watch tonight;

Perchance 'twill walk again.

**HORATIO.** I warrant you it will.

**HAMLET.** If it assume my noble father's person,

I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape

And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,

If you have hitherto46 conceal'd this sight,

Let it be tenable47 in your silence still;

And whatsoever else shall hap48 tonight,

Give it an understanding, but no tongue.

I wil requite49 your loves. So, fare ye well.

Upon the platform 'twixt50 eleven and twelve,

I'll visit you.

ALL.

Our duty to your honour.

**HAMLET.** Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

[Exeunt HORATIO, MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.]

My father's spirit in arms! All is not well;

I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!

Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,

Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

(from _**Hamlet**_)

**_Hamlet_****,** **the first of the great tragedies**, is generally regarded as Shakespeare’s most popular play on the stage, for it has the qualities of a “blood-and-thunder” thriller and a philosophical exploration of life and death. And the timeless appeal of this mighty dramalies in its combination of **intrigue, emotional conflict and searching philosophic melancholy**.《哈姆雷特》是创作时间最早，也是最负盛名的一部悲剧，因为剧中充满了险象环生的情节与对生和死的哲学探讨。这部剧作经久不衰的魅力，就在于它融合了阴谋情感冲突及对哲理与忧郁的探求。

Hamlet is urged by ghost to seek revenge for his father’s “foul and most unnatural murder.” But Hamlet has none of the single-minded blood lust of the earlies revengers. It is not because he is incapable of action, but because the cast of his mind is so speculative, so questioning, and so contemplative that action, when it finally comes, seems almostlike defeat, diminishing rather than adding to the stature of the hero. (哈姆雷特的父王在他面前显灵)同时激励王子为自己不该发生的惨剧而复仇，可是哈姆雷特不具备当时复仇者那种头脑简单而又嗜血成性的品格，这并不是因为他没有采取行动的能力，而是**因为他的头脑太复杂，多疑而又好沉思**，因此每当他采取行动时总是以失败告终，这一切为他这个人物形象笼上了阴影。

**For such a figure,** **soliloquy**(大段独白)**is a natural medium, a** **necessary release of his anguish. By revealing the power-seeking, the jostling for place, the hidden motives, the courteous superficialities that veil lust and guilt, Shakespeare condemns the hypocrisy and treachery and general corruptionat the royal court.** 通过揭示无尽的权欲、篡位的恶行、暗藏的阴险动机及掩盖罪恶欲望的面纱——表面上的谦恭客套，莎士比亚严厉谴责了皇宫内的虚伪，背信弃义以及腐朽成风。

为什么愁云依旧笼罩在你的身上？

  

  

[莎士比亚在《哈姆雷特》第一场戏中营造了一种阴暗、鬼魅的气氛，第二场戏则描写了刚刚加冕的克劳狄斯国王看似欢快的宫廷。如果说城堡外弥漫着恐惧和焦虑的气氛，那么城堡内的房间则是国王、王后和群臣拼命装作一切正常的样子，极力试图驱散这种气氛。很难想象还有比这更错综复杂的家庭动态或更失衡的政治局势了，但克劳狄乌斯还是向他的臣子们宣扬一种平衡的道德观，保证将他对国王之死的悲伤和他对国王婚礼的喜悦维持并结合在一起。然而，尽管克劳狄斯做出了种种努力，宫廷中的欢乐却显得肤浅。这主要是因为克劳狄乌斯承诺遵循的平衡理念是不自然的。怎么可能在为兄弟之死而悲伤和为娶了死去兄弟的妻子而高兴之间取得平衡呢？克劳狄斯的演说中充满了矛盾的词语、观点和短语，以 "虽然我们亲爱的王兄哈姆雷特新丧未久，我们的心里应当充满了悲痛 "开头，将死亡和腐朽的观点与绿色、生长和新生的观点结合在一起。他还提到了 "我已经和我旧日的长嫂，当今的王后"、"失败的喜悦"、"吉祥和垂落的眼睛"、"葬礼中的欢笑 "和 "婚姻中的悲歌"。这些明目张胆的不诚实行为的结果是，这一幕与第一幕一样描绘了丹麦的严峻形势。第一幕描绘了丹麦潜伏的恐惧和超自然的危险，而第二幕则暗示了国王及其宫廷的腐败和软弱。](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247485615&idx=1&sn=3596a844514e0f085da610eab78d5190&chksm=c2a33500f5d4bc16adc1365741f2f6eb28cd842fe4d77f875a47bb33a4b2111788bcc29f659e&scene=21#wechat_redirect)
