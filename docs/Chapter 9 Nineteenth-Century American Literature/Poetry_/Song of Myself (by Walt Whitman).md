## About Walt Whitman

Walt Whitman (1819-1892) was born on Long Island, New York. The family moved to Brooklyn in 1823. At the age of 12, he went to work as a printer for newspapers for a few years, and then he worked intermittently as a country schoolteacher until 1841. By 1848, he had worked for ten different newspapers and had become an active citizen in Brooklyn political affairs, often joining in the debate over slavery and other heated issues of the time. 

Whitman enjoyed a rich intellectual life in New York: he attended numerous lectures (including Emerson's famous address "The Poet”), kept up with all sorts of original theories in the sciences, debated new philosophical constructs, and listened enthusiastically to all sorts of music. He later recalled these times as "days of preparation" and "the gathering of the forces" for the publication of his masterpiece, Leaves of Grass, which he self-published in 1855. The collection included twelve poems praised by Emerson as "the beginning of a great career". The earlier editions of Leaves of Grass (1855, 1856, and 1860) announced the arrival of a brand new voice in American literature. 

Whitman ignored the poetic conventions and created something new in American letters. For instance, he did not follow a patterned rhyme scheme nor any regularity of metre. His poetry is free verse, fitting his subject matter and feeling. In the meantime, he made extensive revisions: adding new poems, retitling poems, changing the order in which the poems appear, deleting or reworking lines in various poems, dropping some poems, and refashioning punctuation. Within a span of 37 years up to the final edition in 1891-1892, Leaves of Grass had expanded into a collection of about 400 poems.

Walt Whitman's work included not only his poetry in Leaves of Grass, but also, more importantly, his shaping of the national character. Reading Whitman's poetry in the historical context, we may feel that his poetry stages the emergence of a new kind of American individual, who is eager for self-accomplishment, aggressive in the pursuit of material success, outspoken for an unbridled individualism in an expanding capitalist society at the end of the nineteenth century.

## About This Selection

No anthology of American poetry can exclude Whitman's "Song of Myself", which has long been credited as "representing the core of Whitman's poetic vision". The whole poem is composed of 52 numbered sections of varied length and form. The sections vary in length and structure; each is written in free verse. Three sections (1, 7, 52) are taken from the poem in this selection.

Sections 1 and 52 are the beginning and ending verses of this epic poem of universal celebration of individuals and humanity. In between, section 7 is selected to show Whitman's ideal of universal equality and animism. The poet avers in this section that death must be just as "lucky" as birth, and he, like all human beings, is limitless in their beings, and he knows he is guiding their way to immortality. In section one, Whitman states clearly his purpose: to celebrate himself and the whole of humanity. He claims that every bit of his body and soul is that of all human beings. In the final section, Whitman sees a hawk and feels humbled. The day leads him on to the "ending day". The ending day might be a metaphor for death. At any rate, the poet's hair has grown "white", and he shakes his "locks" at the setting sun. He ends the poem by saying that we shouldn't be discouraged if we go looking for him but can't find him. He is always ahead of us moving forward.

## 沃尔特·惠特曼概述 

沃尔特·惠特曼（1819-1892）在纽约长岛出生。1823年，全家迁往布鲁克林。他12岁开始在报纸上工作，后来成为乡村教师。到1841年，他已在十家报纸工作过，并积极参与布鲁克林政治事务，关注奴隶制等热门议题。 惠特曼沉浸在纽约丰富的知识生活中，参加各种讲座、了解科学理论、辩论哲学构想、热爱音乐。他将这段时光称为《草叶集》创作的“准备日”和“力量的聚集日”，并于1855年自费出版此诗集。

这部作品由12首诗组成，得到爱默生的赞誉，被视为美国文学中一个全新声音的开端。 惠特曼打破了诗歌常规，创新美国文学。他的自由诗不拘泥于押韵格式和韵律规律，符合其主题和感受。通过广泛修改，《草叶集》在37年中扩展为约400首诗歌。 惠特曼的作品不仅是《草叶集》，更重要的是他对美国民族性格的形塑。阅读其诗歌，或许我们会看到他代表了一种新型美国个体的出现，渴望自我实现，坚持个人主义，直面资本主义社会。

## 本选集简介 

任何一部美国诗集都无法忽视惠特曼的《自我之歌》，长久被视为他诗歌愿景的核心。这首诗包含52个不同长度和形式的编号部分，每个部分以自由诗体写成。本选集摘录了这首诗的第1、7、52节。 第1和52节为这部颂扬个人和人类的史诗的开头和结尾，而第7节展现了惠特曼关于普遍平等和宇宙存在的理念。诗人强调，死亡应像生命一样“幸运”，他认为存在无限延伸，指引人类走向永恒。在首部分中，惠特曼明确表示他要歌颂自己和全人类。诗末亦展现了他的谦卑和对生命更深刻的理解。

### Song of Myself (1892 version)

BY [WALT WHITMAN](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman)

**1**  

I celebrate myself, and sing myself,  

And what I assume you shall assume,  

For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.  

  

I loafe and invite my soul,  

I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.  

  

My tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air,  

Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,  

I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,  

Hoping to cease not till death.  

  

Creeds and schools in abeyance,  

Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,  

I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,  

Nature without check with original energy.  

  

**7**  

Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?  

I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.  

  

I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and boots,  

And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,  

The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.  

  

I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,  

I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself,  

(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)  

  

Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,  

For me those that have been boys and that love women,  

For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,  

For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers,  

For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,  

For me children and the begetters of children.  

  

Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,  

I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,  

And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.


**52**  

The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.  

  

I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,  

I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.  

  

The last scud of day holds back for me,  

It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,  

It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.  

  

I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,  

I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.  

  

I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,  

If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.  

  

You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,  

But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,  

And filter and fibre your blood.  

  

Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,  

Missing me one place search another,  

I stop somewhere waiting for you.
