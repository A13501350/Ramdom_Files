## About Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) was born in Portland, Maine. He was a precocious boy who started school very early, attending the Portland Academy when he was only six and entering Bowdoin College at thirteen. At the college, he studied hard, read avidly and had his poems published. Upon graduation, he was offered a professorship of modern languages at the College provided that he would first study in Europe. So he took sail on May 15, 1826. Back in America in 1829, Longfellow became one of the first professors of modern languages in any US college. A few years later, he was accepted to teach modern languages at Harvard, again on the condition that he would enrich himself in Europe to prepare for the job. So Longfellow sailed to London. This time he enriched himself not only in German but also in Swedish and Finnish languages. At the end of 1836, Longfellow returned to America and assumed his professorship at Harvard. His first volume of poetry, Voices of the Night, was published in 1839. The collection contained "A Psalm of Life". In 1841 Longfellow published Ballads and Other Poems. The next year, while sailing home after a stay in Germany, his Poems on Slavery appeared. His big success came not only in such short poems but also in such long narrative poems as Evangeline (1847), The Song of Hiawatha (1855), and The Courtship of Miles Standish (1858). In 1854, Longfellow resigned from his position at Harvard to give his full attention to writing. After the death of his second wife in 1861, Longfellow almost completely stopped his writing. Driven by the need for spiritual relief, he spent several years translating Dante's Divine Comedy. He eventually recovered from the blow and published more poems, including such long poems as Aftermath (1873), The Hanging of the Crane (1874), and Morituri Salutamus (1875), Longfellow is known in American literature as the most popular of all living poets during his time. His reputation among nineteenth-century American poets is second only to that of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson.

## About This Selection

Below are two poems by Longfellow. They are contrasted with each other in themes and tones.

The first one "A salm of Life" was once widely read, admired, often memorized, and broadly influential, particularly in the nineteenth century. As suggested by the poem's subtitle, the poem takes the form of a dramatic monologue. In the poem, the speaker, the "Heart of the Young Man", disagrees with the psalmist who claims that life is an "empty dream". The psalmist alludes to the biblical fatalism: "For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." However, the poem's speaker states that this line refers only to the human body—not the soul. Then the speaker exhorts the reader to make life "sublime" despite the knowledge of the impending death. At the poem's end, the speaker calls upon the reader to strive, achieve, and enjoy life. The poem's tone is didactic, for the poet intends to provide counsels to young men who want to know the meaning of living in this world.

The other poem, "The Slave's Dream", is about a slave who, while being beaten, escapes into his own mind. He dreams about his former life in Africa and is then able to release his pain and die in peace. While on an ocean voyage across the Atlantic in 1842, Longfellow got inspired to write about slavery, so he composed seven poems exploring the subject. Longfellow never experienced slavery first-hand, but he believed slavery was a cruel institution against humanity. This poem sympathizes with the harsh life that many slaves experienced. Readers were surprised that he wrote about an ugly subject in such a beautiful way. The poem has the quality of striking a sympathetic chord in readers, arousing in them indignation against slavery.

## 关于亨利·沃兹沃思·朗费罗 

亨利·沃兹沃思·朗费罗出生于缅因州波特兰，是一个富有天赋的孩子。他年幼时勤奋学习，六岁就进入波特兰学院，十三岁进入鲍登学院。在学院里，他刻苦钻研，阅读如饥似渴，并发表了自己的诗歌作品。毕业后，学院为他提供了现代语言教授的职位，条件是他必须先去欧洲深造。于是，1826年5月15日，他启程前往欧洲。1829年回到美国后，朗费罗成为美国大学第一批现代语言教授之一。几年后，他被哈佛大学录取为现代语言教授，条件是他必须在欧洲积累知识为这份工作做准备。于是，朗费罗航行到了伦敦。这一次，他不仅学习了德语，还学习了瑞典语和芬兰语。1836年底，朗费罗回到美国，开始在哈佛大学担任教授。

他的第一本诗集《夜之声》于1839年出版，其中包含了“生命颂歌”。1841年，朗费罗出版了《民谣和其他诗歌》。第二年，他在德国逗留后乘船回家，发表了《论奴隶制诗》。他的巨大成功不仅来自短诗，还来自象征深远的叙事诗，如《伊万杰琳》（1847年）、《海华沙之歌》（1855年）和《迈尔斯·斯坦迪什的求爱》（1858年）。1854年，朗费罗辞去哈佛大学职务，全身心投入写作。1861年第二任妻子去世后，朗费罗几乎完全停止了写作。出于精神解脱的需要，他花了几年时间翻译但丁的《神曲》。最终，朗费罗从打击中恢复过来，发表了更多诗歌，包括长诗《余波》（1873年）、《吊鹤》（1874年）和《死亡的哀悼》（1875年）。

朗费罗在美国文学中被誉为同时代最受欢迎的诗人，其声望仅次于沃尔特·惠特曼和艾米莉·狄金森。 

## 关于此选集

以下是朗费罗的两首诗，它们在主题和语调上形成鲜明对比。 

第一首《生命的颂歌》曾经被广泛阅读、欣赏，并经常被背诵，对19世纪尤其具有广泛的影响力。正如这首诗的副标题暗示的那样，这首诗采用了戏剧性独白的形式。在诗中，说话者“年轻人的内心”不同意诗作者所说的生活是一场“空幻梦境”。诗作者隐晦地暗示了圣经中的宿命论：“人原是尘土，尘土还归于尘土。”然而，诗作者指出，这只是指涉人的身体，而非灵魂。然后，作者劝告读者，尽管死亡在望，也要活出“高尚”。诗的结尾，作者呼吁读者努力奋斗，实现理想，享受人生。这首诗的语气充满说教色彩，因为诗人意在为那些探寻生命意义的年轻人提供建议。 

另一首诗《奴隶的梦》讲述了一个奴隶在遭受殴打时逃入内心深处的故事。他梦见自己在非洲的过往，然后能够摆脱痛苦，安详地离去。1842年，在一次横渡大西洋的海上航行中，朗费罗受到启发，开始撰写有关奴隶制度的文章，从而创作了七首诗探讨这一主题。朗费罗虽未亲历奴隶生活，但认为奴隶制度是反人类的残酷制度。这首诗对许多奴隶所遭受的苦难表示同情。读者惊讶于他能以如此优美的方式描绘这一丑恶主题。这首诗具有引发读者同情，唤起对奴隶制度愤慨的特质。

### A Psalm of Life

亨利·沃兹沃思·朗费罗

人生颂
杨德豫 译

```
What the Heart of the Young Man Said to the Psalmist

年轻人的心对歌者说的话

`   `

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,

不要在哀伤诗句里告诉我：

Life is but an empty dream!—

“人生不过是一场幻梦！”

For the soul is dead that slumbers,

灵魂睡着了，就等于死了，

And things are not what they seem.

事物的真相与外表不同。

`   `

Life is real! Life is earnest!

人生是真的！人生是实的！

And the grave is not its goal;

它的归宿决不是荒坟；

Dust thou art, to dust thou returnest,

“你本是尘土，必归于尘土”，

Was not spoken of the soul.

这是指躯壳，不是指灵魂。

`   `

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,

我们命定的目标和道路

Is our destined end or way;

不是享乐，也不是受苦；

But to act, that each to-morrow

而是行动，在每个明天

Find us farther than to-day.

都超越今天，跨出新步。

`   `

Art is long, and Time is fleeting,

智艺无穷，时光飞逝；

And our hearts, though stout and brave,

这颗心，纵然英勇刚强，

Still, like muffled drums, are beating

也只如闷声擂动的鼙鼓，

Funeral marches to the grave.

奏着进行曲，向坟地送葬。

`   `

In the world's broad field of battle,

世界是一片辽阔战场，

In the bivouac of Life,

人生是到处扎寨安营；

Be not like dumb, driven cattle!

莫学那听人驱策的哑畜，

Be a hero in the strife!

做一个威武善战的英雄！

`   `

Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!

别指靠将来，不管它多可爱！

Let the dead Past bury its dead!

把已逝的过去永久掩埋！

Act,—act in the living Present!

行动吧——趁着活生生的现在！

Heart within, and God o'erhead!

胸中有赤心，头上有真宰！

`   `

Lives of great men all remind us

伟人的生平启示我们：

We can make our lives sublime,

我们能够生活得高尚，

And, departing, leave behind us

而当告别人世的时候，

Footprints on the sands of time;

留下脚印在时间的沙上；

`   `

Footprints, that perhaps another,

也许我们有一个弟兄

Sailing o'er life's solemn main,

航行在庄严的人生大海，

A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,

遇险沉了船，绝望的时刻，

Seeing, shall take heart again.

会看到这脚印而振作起来。

`   `

Let us, then, be up and doing,

那么，打起精神来干吧，

With a heart for any fate;

对任何命运要敢于担戴；

Still achieving, still pursuing,

不断地进取，不断地追求，

Learn to labor and to wait.

要善于劳动，善于等待。
```

### The Slave's Dream
亨利·沃兹沃思·朗费罗

奴隶的梦杨德豫 译

```
Beside the ungathered rice he lay,

他躺在没有割完的稻禾旁，

His sickle in his hand;

镰刀还握在手上；

His breast was bare, his matted hair

蓬乱的头发埋入沙土，

Was buried in the sand.

露出黧黑的胸膛。

Again, in the mist and shadow of sleep,

他在睡梦的烟雾阴影里

He saw his Native Land.

又一次看见了故乡。

`   `

Wide through the landscape of his dreams

穿越他梦中的辽阔大地，

The lordly Niger flowed;

尼日尔河水奔流；

Beneath the palm-trees on the plain

他又成了尊严的国王，

Once more a king he strode;

在平原棕树下行走；

And heard the tinkling caravans

又听见商队清脆的驼铃

Descend the mountain road.

慢悠悠下了山头。

`   `

He saw once more his dark-eyed queen

又看见他那黑眼珠王后

Among her children stand;

站在孩子们中间；

They clasped his neck, they kissed his cheeks,

他们搂住他脖子，抓住手，

They held him by the hand!—

一个劲亲着他的脸！——

A tear burst from the sleeper's lids

他的睡眼里迸出一滴泪，

And fell into the sand.

滚落到沙土里面。

`   `

And then at furious speed he rode

沿着尼日尔河畔的沙岸，

Along the Niger's bank;

他骑着马儿飞跑；

His bridle-reins were golden chains,

手上的缰绳是黄金链子，

And, with a martial clank,

每一次纵跳，都听到

At each leap he could feel his scabbard of steel

青钢的刀鞘铿锵作响，

Smiting his stallion's flank.

拍打着马儿身腰。

`   `

Before him, like a blood-red flag,

像血红的旌旗，一群火烈鸟

The bright flamingoes flew;

飞翔在他的前面；

From morn till night he followed their flight,

他追随它们，整天奔驰在

O'er plains where the tamarind grew,

婆树生长的平原，

Till he saw the roofs of Caffre huts,

直到他望见卡菲人村舍，

And the ocean rose to view.

大海也闪入眼帘。

`   `

At night he heard the lion roar,

夜间，他听到狮子吼叫，

And the hyena scream,

也听到鬣狗嘶鸣，

And the river-horse, as he crushed the reeds

而当他双足踏倒芦苇，

Beside some hidden stream;

走在隐僻的河滨，

And it passed, like a glorious roll of drums,

又听到河马，脚步似擂鼓，

Through the triumph of his dream.

闯过他辉煌梦境。

`   `

The forests, with their myriad tongues,

森林转动千万条舌头，

Shouted of liberty;

高声呼唤着自由；

And the Blast of the Desert cried aloud,

嗓门粗厉的荒漠暴风

With a voice so wild and free,

任性地狂呼怒吼；

That he started in his sleep and smiled

梦中被惊动，他含笑倾听

At their tempestuous glee.

这一曲威猛的合奏。

`   `

He did not feel the driver's whip,

再也不晓得监工的鞭挞，

Nor the burning heat of day;

不觉得烈日的炙烤；

For Death had illumined the Land of Sleep,

因为死亡照亮了睡乡，

And his lifeless body lay

他失却生命的躯壳

A worn-out fetter, that the soul

像一副残破枷锁，已经

Had broken and thrown away!

被灵魂挣脱甩掉！
