## About Emily Dickinson

Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) was born in Amherst, Massachusetts. She graduated from Amherst Academy in 1847 and then attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary for one year. She spent most of her entire life in her family home. Her bedroom window faced a local cemetery, and she observed burials almost daily. She never married and had no romantic relationship. 

In 1850, upon her friend's introduction, Dickinson read Emerson's poetry and was encouraged to write her own poems. The tuming point in Dickinson's career as a poet came in her late twenties. From then on, particularly from 1858 to 1863, poetry became her primary activity. After an 1864 visit to Boston for eye treatment, Dickinson did not leave Amherst for the remainder of her life. By 1870, she did not even go beyond her house and garden, though she did socialize by sending brief letters, some of them accompanied by poems, flowers, or fruit. Visitors to her family might regard her eccentricities as unnatural, but her friends and family knew her mind was on her poetry. In her lifetime, Dickinson wrote nearly eighteen hundred poems. Nevertheless, her work was essentially unknown to contemporary readers since only a handful of her poems were published during her lifetime and a vast treasure of her manuscripts was not discovered until after her death in 1886.
These poems establish her, along with Walt Whitman, as one of America's two seminal poets.

Dickinson wrote her poems in an unconventional style that revolutionized the genre. Instead of traditional rhyme schemes and punctuation, she used broken metre, seemingly random capitalization, and numerous dashes to convey complex thoughts and feelings, and none of her poems were titled. The subjects of her poems ranged from the inevitability of death to the simple joys of the natural world. Their tone reflected what must have been Dickinson's complex emotional range: brooding and joyous, witty and sarcastic, morose and hopeful.


## About This Selection

In this selection, you will read three poems by Emily Dickinson. The first one "Success" may strike a sympathetic chord with everyone who is striving for success. The poet claims that success is best understood by those who repeatedly fail. She illustrates this claim by contrasting a victorious army with a fallen soldier from the other side. The second one, entitled "I", tells us that it is better to be a nobody than somebody-that being common and nameless is preferable to fame or public recognition. This is reminiscent of what a Chinese poet has famously said, "it is too cold to stay on high (高处不胜寒)." The third poem collected here is entitled "Hope". Using surprising imagery and figurative language, the poet makes "Hope" a strong-willed bird that lives within the human soul— and sings its song no matter the circumstance. We are reminded that the power of hope is always with us. Hope has been helpful in times of hazard. It must be noted that none of Emily Dickinson's poems were titled. She didn't give her poems a title; she simply wrote the lines down. The titles provided for these poems here are simply for the convenience of differentiation.

## 关于艾米莉·狄金森

艾米莉·狄金森 (1830-1886) 出生于马萨诸塞州阿默斯特。1847 年，她毕业于阿默斯特学院，随后在曼荷莲女子学院学习了一年。她一生大部分时间都在家里度过。她卧室的窗户正对着当地的墓地，她几乎每天都会去墓地看守葬礼。她从未结过婚，也没有谈过恋爱。 

1850 年，在朋友的介绍下，狄金森读到了爱默生的诗，并受到鼓励开始创作自己的诗。狄金森诗人生涯的转折点出现在她二十多岁的时候。从那时起，特别是从 1858 年到 1863 年，诗歌成了她的主要活动。1864 年，狄金森去波士顿接受眼科治疗后，余生都没有离开过阿默斯特。到 1870 年，她甚至没有走出过家门和花园，尽管她确实通过发送短信进行社交，其中一些还附有诗歌、鲜花或水果。来她家做客的人可能会认为她的怪癖不自然，但她的朋友和家人知道她专注于诗歌。

在她的一生中，狄金森写了近一千八百首诗。然而，她的作品对当代读者来说基本上是未知的，因为她在世时只有少数几首诗出版，而她的大量手稿直到 1886 年她去世后才被发现。 这些诗使她与沃尔特·惠特曼一起成为美国两位开创性诗人之一。 狄金森以一种非传统的风格创作诗歌，彻底改变了这一流派。她没有使用传统的押韵格式和标点符号，而是使用不规则的韵律、看似随机的大写字母和大量破折号来表达复杂的思想和感受，而且她的诗都没有标题。她的诗歌主题从死亡的必然性到自然界的简单快乐，无所不包。这些诗句的语调反映了狄金森复杂的情感范围：沉思和快乐、诙谐和讽刺、忧郁和充满希望。 

## 关于本选集

在本选集中，您将阅读艾米莉·狄金森的三首诗。第一首《成功》可能触动了所有为成功而奋斗的人的心弦。诗人声称，成功只有那些屡次失败的人才能理解。她通过将一支胜利的军队与另一方阵亡的士兵进行对比来说明这一说法。
第二首诗名为《我》，告诉我们，做一个无名小卒比做一个大人物要好——平凡和无名比名声或公众认可要好。这让人想起一位中国诗人的名言：“高处不胜寒。”
第三首诗名为《希望》。诗人用令人惊奇的意象和比喻语言，把“希望”描绘成一只意志坚强的鸟，栖息在人类的灵魂中——无论在什么情况下，它都会高歌。这提醒我们，希望的力量始终伴随着我们。在危难时刻，希望总是有帮助的。必须指出的是，艾米莉·狄金森的所有诗歌都没有标题。她没有给她的诗起标题；她只是把诗行写下来。这里为这些诗提供的标题只是为了方便区分。
