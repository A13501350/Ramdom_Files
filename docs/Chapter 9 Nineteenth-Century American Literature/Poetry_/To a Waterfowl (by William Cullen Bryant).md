## About William Cullen Bryant

William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878) is often regarded as a transitional figure for his fluency in expressing Romantic themes drawn from nature in conventional neoclassical verse forms. Born in Cummington, Bryant began writing poems when he was ten. In 1810, he entered Williams College. By then, Bryant was already known as a poet. He left Williams without graduating, hoping to attend Yale, which he failed to do for financial reasons. In 1811, Bryant went to Worthington to study law. He continued to write verse, and in 1817, five of his poems appeared in the North American Review. Over the next few years, Bryant published more poems and essays. In 1821, he published Poems, his first book of poetry. This successful year marked the beginning of his adult career as a national man of letters. In 1825, Bryant moved to New York City and soon became the editor-in-chief of the Evening Post. Under his direction and often through his editorials, the journal became a major organ of democratic principles in American journalism. In the meantime, Bryant continued to write poetry. His later volumes of verse included The Fountain and Other Poems (1842), The White-Footed Deer (1844), and Thirty Poems (1864). In 1870-1872, Bryant published his translations of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. 

Bryant's poems of nature celebrate the opening up of the new nation. His poetry, especially his blank verse, can be seen as a development moving from Wordsworth's theories and examples to the American model of Whitman's free verse, celebrating the self and the newly emerging national identity. Such memorable poems as "Thanatopsis" and "To a Waterfowl" capture the universal themes in simple language. Scholars have judged Bryant an able student of prosody who influenced other poets both in his theory and in his practice.

## About This Selection

Bryant was inspired to write "To a Waterfowl" when he was a twenty-one-year-old aspiring lawyer on his way to a new town. As he walked through New England hills, sad and concerned about what would happen to him in his new life, he saw a solitary bird flying against a sunset and wondered about its destiny. When he stopped at an inn, he wrote what became the poem's last stanza. Both lyric and didactic, the poem is considered one of the representative works in nineteenth-century American poetry.


## 威廉·卡伦·布莱恩特简介

威廉·卡伦·布莱恩特（1794-1878）被广泛视为一个过渡人物，因为他以传统的新古典主义诗歌形式流畅地表达了从自然中汲取的浪漫主题。出生于卡明顿的布莱恩特在十岁开始涉足诗歌创作。1810年，他进入威廉姆斯学院。那时，布莱恩特已然成为一位备受瞩目的诗人。尽管未能顺利毕业，他便离开了威廉姆斯学院，企图进入耶鲁大学，可惜因为经济原因未能成行。1811年，布莱恩特前往沃辛顿学习法律，并继续着诗歌创作。1817年，他的五首诗发表在《北美评论》上。此后的几年里，布莱恩特持续发表了更多的诗歌和散文。1821年，他出版了个人的首部诗集《诗集》，这一年的成功标志着他职业生涯的开端作为一名全国性文人。1825年，布莱恩特移居至纽约市，并很快成为《晚邮报》的主编。在他的领导下，该杂志通过他的社论成为美国新闻界民主原则的主要倡导者。与此同时，布莱恩特一直在坚持着诗歌创作。他后续出版的诗集包括《泉水与其他》（1842年）、《白足鹿》（1844年）以及《诗三十首》（1864年）。1870至1872年，布莱恩特发布了荷马作品《伊利亚特》和《奥德赛》的译本。


布莱恩特的自然诗赞美着这个新兴国家的开放性。他的诗歌，特别是他那些没有韵律的作品，被视为是从华兹华斯的理论和实践中转向了惠特曼自由诗模式的美国发展典范，赞美个体自我和新生的国民认同。《死亡观》和《致水鸟》等经典作品用简单的词语捕捉到了普世主题。学者们一致认为布莱恩特是一位杰出的韵律学者，他的理论与实践对其他诗人均造成了深远的影响。 

## 本选集简介

威廉·卡伦·布莱恩特在21岁时受到启发，创作了《致水鸟》。当时，他是一位充满抱负的律师，正踏上新城镇的征程。当他穿过新英格兰的丘陵时，深感忧伤与忧虑，对新生活一无所知，看见一只孤独的鸟在夕阳中飞翔，不禁纳闷它的命运如何。随着他在旅馆停驻之际，他完成了这首诗的落笔。这首既感情流露又具有启发意义的诗作被誉为19世纪美国诗歌的代表之作。

Whither, midst falling dew,

在夕阳残照中间，

While glow the heavens with the last steps of day

冒着滴落着的露水，

Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue

掠过玫瑰色的云端，

Thy solitary way?

你独自往哪里飞？

`   `

Vainly the fowler's eye

猎人休想伤害你，

Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong

他觉察不到你飞行，

As, darkly seen against the crimson sky,

你背负紫霭滑得疾，

Thy figure floats along.

形迹模糊难看清。

`   `

Seek'st thou the plashy brink

你在寻找芦苇荡，

Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,

抑或是宽阔的河畔，

Or where the rocking billows rise and sing

抑或是起伏的波浪

On the chafed ocean side?

不断冲击着海岸？

`   `

There is a Power whose care

有个神将你照管，

Teaches thy way along that pathless coast—

教你认清自己的路，

The desert and illimitable air—

在海边、沙漠和空间

Lone wandering, but not lost.

孤身漂泊不迷途。

`   `

All day thy wings have fanned,

整日拍着双翼，

At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere,

不管天高空气稀冷，

Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,

从未倦得扑向大地，

Though the dark night is near.

虽然暮色已昏朦。

`   `

And soon that toil shall end;

辛苦旅程将完毕，

Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,

你将有新巢过夏天，

And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,

将与伙伴齐声长啼，

Soon, o'er thy sheltered nest.

芦苇将被巢压弯。

`   `

Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven

我已经望不见你，

Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart

你已经消失在天边，

Deeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given,

可你给予我的教益，

And shall not soon depart.

我久久铭记在心间。

`   `

He who, from zone to zone,

教你在辽阔高空

Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,

平安地翱翔的那神，

In the long way that I must tread alone,

在我漫长的旅程中

Will lead my steps aright.

也将给我以指引。
