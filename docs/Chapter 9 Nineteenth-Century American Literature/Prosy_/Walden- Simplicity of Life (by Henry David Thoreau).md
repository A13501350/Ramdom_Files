## About Henry David Thoreau

Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was born in Concord, Massachusetts. After his graduation from Harvard, Thoreau taught briefly in a Concord school. From 1838 to 1841, he ran his own school in Concord, teaching Latin, Greek, and science. Then, he spent 1843 in Staten Island tutoring Ralph Waldo Emerson's brother William's children. He also worked at various times as a house painter, carpenter, mason, surveyor, and pencil maker. He also helped Emerson edit the Transcendentalist magazine The Dial. During a school vacation, Thoreau and his brother John travelled by canoe along the Concord and Merrimack rivers. He later transformed their experiences into A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849), one of only two Thoreau books published during his lifetime. On July 4, 1845, Thoreau moved into a cabin he had built at Walden Pond, two miles from Concord. He lived there, alone, for more than two years. There Thoreau recorded his experience and thoughts in the form of journal entries, essays, poems, and lectures. He reshaped his writing and published it under the title Walden; or, Life in the Woods
(1854), which became Thoreau's supreme achievement and one of the most accomplished works in American literature. Written in a baroque, epigrammatic style, Walden is not simply the record of one man's hermitic life; it is a quest for the truth of life itself.

## About This Selection

In the section subtitled "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For" in his famous book Walden, from which this episode is collected, Thoreau tells how he surveyed to find his retreat and explains why he chose to live alone in the woods. In this piece of prose, Thoreau clarifies what life means to him and how one can truly live a meaningful and enjoyable life.

## 亨利·戴维·梭罗的故事 

亨利·戴维·梭罗（1817-1862）生于马萨诸塞州康科德。毕业于哈佛大学后，他曾在康科德的一所学校任教。从1838年至1841年，他经营自己的学校，在那里教授拉丁语、希腊语和科学。随后，1843年，他做起了家教，在斯塔顿岛为拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生的兄弟威廉的孩子。梭罗做过油漆工、木匠、泥瓦匠、测量员和铅笔匠。他还协助爱默生编辑超验主义杂志《日晷》。

在学校假期里，梭罗和兄弟约翰乘着独木舟探索康科德河和梅里马克河。最终，他将这段奇遇写成了《康科德河和梅里马克河上的一周》（1849），这是梭罗一生中唯一两本出版的书之一。1845年7月4日，梭罗搬进了离康科德两英里远的瓦尔登湖边的小屋。在那里独自生活了两年多。在那里，他以日记、散文、诗歌和演讲记录了自己的经历和思考。重新整理后，他以《瓦尔登湖：或者说森林生活》（1854年）的名义出版，这是梭罗最伟大的成就之一，也是美国文学中最成功的杰作之一。《瓦尔登湖》以巴洛克风格写成，不仅仅是一部个人隐居生活的记录；这是对生活本身真理探索的表现。
