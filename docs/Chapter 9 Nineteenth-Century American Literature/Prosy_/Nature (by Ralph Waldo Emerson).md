## About Ralph Waldo Emerson

Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882) was born in Boston. His father's death in 1811 left the family poor, but his mother managed to send Emerson to Harvard. In 1829, Emerson became a minister of Boston's Second Church. But in 1832, he resigned, travelling for a year to Europe. There he met Coleridge, Wordsworth, Carlyle and others of his literary heroes. 

Returning to Boston in 1833, Emerson soon began his numerous lecture series across the country. In 1835, Emerson moved to Concord, where he lived the rest of his life. One year later, Emerson published a small pamphlet called Nature. This book served as the rallying cry for the Transcendentalist movement in America. Briefly, Transcendentalism is an American literary, philosophical, religious, and political movement led by Emerson. The movement was stimulated by English and German Romanticism, the biblical criticism, and the skepticism. The Transcendentalists believed that a new era was at hand. They were critics of their contemporary society for its unthinking conformity, and urged that each person find, in Emerson's words, "an original relation to the universe". Philosophically the Transcendentalists followed Immanuel Kant in believing that man can transcend sensory experience; they thus rejected the view of John Locke, who maintained that all knowledge came from and was rooted in the senses. In one of his famous addresses, "The American Scholar", later hailed as America's intellectual declaration of independence, Emerson warned against the tyranny of received opinion, particularly as it appeared in books. From 1842 to 1844, Emerson edited The Dial, a quarterly magazine that expressed his doctrine of Transcendentalism. In 1841, he published Essays. This book was followed by Essays: Second Series (1844), which calls for an American poet who would sing of American life in nature. In the next decade, Emerson published three important works: Representative Men (1850), English Traits (1856), and The Conduct of Life (1860). After the American Civil War, Emerson published two more collections of his essays, Society and Solitude (1870) and Letters and Social Aims (1876). Unlike Benjamin Franklin, the achiever, Emerson's American Dream meant the opportunity to live in harmony with oneself, to save not one's pennies but one's soul. Emerson's lectures and essays continually informed American thought and writing with meanings for generations.

## About This Selection

Below is an excerpt from Emerson's famous essay "Nature". It is the beginning of Chapter I, where Emerson outlines his beliefs regarding the relationship between humankind and nature.

Emerson begins by asserting that humans need to develop their own sense of self and beliefs. He believes that solitary reflection within nature is the best way to accomplish this. When one is alone, away from villages and cities, one is more able to see the interconnectedness of nature.

When he sees various elements connected to one another, he is able to hold a more holistic view of the world. Nature is not about all the separate pieces but about how they work together to form a greater whole. As Emerson sees it, people's natural surroundings can meet their material needs and help them realize nature's aesthetic value, achieve spiritual growth, think more clearly, and attain self-discipline.

## 关于本选集 

以下是爱默生著名随笔《自然》的节录。这是第一章的开篇，爱默生在其中阐述了他独到的人与自然观。

爱默生首先强调，人类需要培养自我意识和信念。他认为，独自在自然中沉思是实现这一目标的最佳途径。在远离城市的环境里，一个人更能领悟到自然的神奇之处。 通过观察元素之间的相互联系，人们能更全面地理解世界。对爱默生而言，自然不只是独立的部分，更是宏大整体的组成。自然环境提供了物质需求，促进审美价值体验，助力心灵成长，澄清思想，实现自我约束。
