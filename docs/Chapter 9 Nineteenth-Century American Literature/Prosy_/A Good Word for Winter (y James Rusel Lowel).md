## About James Russell Lowell

James Russel Lowel (1819-1891) was born into a prestigious New England family. Being bom into such a family meant that Lowell was guaranteed success. His parents had him reading before he was four, translating French before he was ten, studying Latin and Greek and gaining admission to Harvard by the time he was fifteen. Lowell secured his professorship in 1855 at Harvard, and took the editorship of the Atlantic Monthly in 1857. He was appointed US Minister to Spain in 1877. Three years later, he had moved up to become the country's ambassador to Great Britain. But Lowell never relied on these advantages alone. He succeeded in his career with his own hard work, his serious commitment to the art of writing, and his enviable record for accomplishing nearly everything he set out to do. Lowell spent nearly fifty years as an apologist for institutional America, articulating clearly and sometimes passionately the principal social, aesthetic, and political beliefs of the educated upper class. Beneath the public success, however, Lowell privately grew more despondent about spending his life as a publicist for the country's most influential periodicals, prestigious universities, and reputable literary circles. His works include several volumes of verse, the satirical Biglow Papers (1848 and 1867, prose and verse), and memorial odes after the Civil War; and various volumes of essays, including Among My Books (1870) and My Study Windows (1871). His Letters were published three years after his death.

## About This Selection

Lowell's prose gives an exquisite aesthetic flavour that appeals to educated readers. This poetic praise of winter in imaginative inspiration and terms is from Lowell's book My Garden Acquaintance and A Good Word for Winter. Note how rich imagery, similes, and personification are used to compare all seasons in a life-like picture of nature for expressing the theme: winter is a brisk and energetic season, a better company than either pretty spring or flowery summer, or melancholy autumn.

## Selected Text

**A Good Word For Winter**

Suppose we grant that Winter is the sleep of the year, what then? I take it upon me to say that his dreams are finer than the best reality of his waking rivals'.

"Sleep, Silence's child, the father of soft Rest," is a very agreeable acquaintance, and most of us are better employed in his company than anywhere else. For my own part, I think Winter a pretty wide-awake old boy, and his bluff? sincerity and hearty ways are more congenial to my mood, and more wholesome for me, than any charms of which his rivals are capable.

Spring is a fickle mistress, who either does not know her own mind, or is so long in making it up, whether you shall have her or not have her, that one gets tired at last of her pretty miffs? and reconciliations. You go to her to be cheered up a bit, and ten to one catch her in the sulks, expecting you to find enough good-humor for both.
（春天是一个花心的情人，要么不知道自己的心，要么长久下不了决心，让人捉摸不透是要她还是不要她，最终被她那娇弄嗔怪和破涕为笑弄得精疲力尽。你去见她本想找点快乐，封十有八九见到她愁眉紧锁，正指望着你能想方设法，既为她排忧解难，又要让自己高兴起来）。

After she has become Mrs. Summer she grows a little more staid' in her demeanor; and her abundant table, where you are sure to get the earliest fruits and vegetables of the season, is a good foundation for steady friendship; but she has lost that delicious aroma of maidenhood, and what was delicately rounded grace in the girl gives more than hints of something like redundance in the matron.

Autumn is the poet of the family. He gets you up a splendor that you would say was made out of real sunset; but it is nothing more than a few hectic leaves, when all is done. He is but a sentimentalist, after all; a kind of Lamartine' whining along the ancestral avenues he has made bare timber of, and begging a contribution of good-spirits from your own savings to keep him in countenance.（秋天是季节家族之中的诗人。他让你早晨披上一身金色的辉煌，让你感到那是日落的晚覆，其实到头来就是一些纷乱的树叶。说到底，秋天不过就是一个感伤者，他有点像拉马丁这样的诗人，在自己用木头铺就的古道上，低诉徘徊，哀求读者从自己的欢乐情感储备中抽出一份施舍，以便让他活得还有点体面。）

But Winter has his delicate sensibilities too, only he does not make them as good as indelicate by thrusting them forever in your face. He is a better poet than Autumn, when he has a mind, but, like a truly great one as he is, he brings you down to your bare manhood, and bids you understand him out of that, with no adventitious helps of association, or he will none of you. He does not touch those melancholy chords on which Autumn is as great a master as Heine?. Well, is there no such thing as thrumming on them and maundering over them till they get out of tune, and you wish some manly hand would crash through them and leave them dangling brokenly forever? Take Winter as you find him, and he turns out to be a thoroughly honest fellow, with no nonsense in him, and tolerating none in you, which is a great comfort in the long run.

## 詹姆斯·罗素·洛威尔简介 

詹姆斯·罗素·洛威尔（1819-1891）出生在一个著名的新英格兰家庭。出生在这样一个家庭意味着洛威尔注定会成功。他的父母让他在四岁之前就能阅读，不到十岁就能翻译法语，学习拉丁语和希腊语，并在十五岁时获得哈佛大学入学资格。1855年，洛威尔在哈佛大学获得了教授职位，并于1857年担任《大西洋月刊》的编辑。1877年，他被任命为美国驻西班牙大使。三年后，他升任美国驻英国大使。但洛威尔从未仅仅依赖于这些优势。他的职业生涯成功来自于他自己的努力、对写作艺术的认真执着以及几乎事事如愿以偿的卓越记录。

洛威尔在近五十年间一直作为美国制度的辩护者，清晰地并有时充满激情地阐述了受过良好教育的上层社会的主要社会、美学和政治信仰。然而，在公开取得成功的背后，洛威尔私下对自己将生命花在成为该国最具影响力的期刊、著名大学和声誉良好的文学圈的宣传员感到更加沮丧。他的作品包括多卷诗集，讽刺作品《比格洛论文》（1848年和1867年，散文和诗歌），以及内战后的追思颂诗；还有各种散文集，包括《我所阅读的书籍》（1870年）和《我的书房窗户》（1871年）。他的信件是在他去世三年后出版的。

**冬天的美德** 


让我们假设冬季是一年中的沉睡时光，那又如何呢？我在此宣称，他的梦境远比其清醒时的竞争者所能展现的最佳现实更加美妙。

“睡眠与寂静之子，柔软和栖息的父亲”，这位令人愉悦的熟人陪伴我们时，多数时候都胜过其他任何场合的消遣。对我个人而言，我认为冬季是一位相当清醒且活力充沛的老伙计，他的直率坦诚和热情洋溢的方式更符合我的心境，也比我从其他季节所体验到的任何魅力都更为健康有益。

春天则是一位反复无常的情人，不是尚未明了自己的心意，便是迟迟无法决定是否接纳你，以至于人们最后难免对她的喜怒无常与和解变得厌倦。你去找她寻求一丝慰藉，结果十有八九会撞见她正处于闷闷不乐的状态，期待着你能调动足够的耐心和爱意来包容她的情绪波动。

当春天变成了夏日夫人后，她的举止变得更加稳重；在她丰盛的餐桌上，你可以品尝到最早的果蔬佳肴，这无疑为稳固友谊奠定了基础；然而，她已失去了少女时代的那份令人陶醉的气息，女孩身上那种圆润优雅的特质，在她成为主妇之后，似乎透露出了一种过分的丰满。

秋天则是家庭中的诗人。他为你编织了一片壮丽景色，仿佛是由真实的落日熔铸而成；然而一切落幕之后，你会发现那不过是几片病态般斑斓的落叶而已。终究，秋天只是一个感伤主义者，宛如一位沿着祖先留下的林荫大道漫步、将曾经繁茂的树木变为光秃枝桠的拉马丁式人物，不断地向你的内心积蓄的情感索要慷慨馈赠，以维持自我形象的尊严。

而冬季同样拥有微妙的感受力，但他并不会将其强加于人以至于显得粗鄙。当他有意表达时，他是一个比秋天更好的诗人；如同真正伟大的诗人那样，他将你带回到赤裸的人性本质，并要求你从这一真实出发理解他，无需借助任何联想的外在帮助，否则他便不会接纳你。他并不触及那些让秋天如海涅般擅长抒发的忧郁琴弦。那么，是不是真的没有那种反复拨弄这些琴弦、沉溺其中直至走调，然后渴望有一双刚毅的手重重地击碎它们，令其永远断裂摇晃的情况呢？接受冬季本来的样子，你会发现他是一个彻头彻尾诚实的人，自身不含任何荒唐，也不容许你在其中有任何荒诞不经的表现，这一点长远看来是一种极大的安慰。
