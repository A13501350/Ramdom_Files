## About Nathaniel Hawthorne

Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) was born in Salem, Massachusetts. His ancestors were among the first Puritans of New England. Noticeably his great-great-grandfather was one of the three judges in the notorious Salem Witch Trials, causing feelings of guilt that provided a theme for many of his stories. Between 1821 and 1825, Hawthorne attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, during which time he began writing short stories, some of them being included in his first collection, Twice-Told Tales. After graduation, he spent the next twelve years in Salem, where he read extensively. As the product of these twelve years, Hawthorne published Fanshawe: A Tale (1828) and more than forty stories and sketches. In 1842, Hawthorne and his wife moved to The Old Manse in Concord. He published the second edition of Twice-Told Tales, and in 1846, his Mosses from an Old Manse appeared. Hawthorne began to receive high critical recognition. He was praised for his "invention, creation, imagination, originality". Then in 1850, The Scarlet Letter was published, for which he became famous. In this novel, Hawthorne developed his most powerful theme of the hardening of the heart in what he called "the unpardonable sin". Later, he published more novels, including The House of the Seven Gables
(1851) and The Blithedale Romance (1852). He also wrote a biography for Franklin Pierce, then the President of the United States. In 1860, Hawthorne published his The Marble Faun, a novel that made him one of the first American writers to write about the experiences of his countrymen in Europe, a theme developed by such later writers as Henry James, William Dean Howells, and Ernest Hemingway. 

Hawthorne kept close friendships with great Transcendentalists such as Emerson, Thoreau and others. The point is, he was too preoccupied with evil, the dangers of sexuality, and the hypocrisy of human beings to accept the optimism and idealism of his Transcendentalist friends. Hawthorne died in 1864 and was buried in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, where Emerson and Thoreau lay in peace.

## About The Scarlet Letter

Hester Prynne, whose husband has been missing for over a ycar, is accused of committing adultery. She refuses to reveal her lover and is forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her clothes to mark her as an adulteress. To raise her illegitimate daughter, Pearl, she makes a living by being a scamstress while suffering from contempt and verbal insults from her neighbours. Mr Prynne, Hester's husband, returns as a physician unrecognized. He assumes a new name, Roger Chillingworth, and succeeds in finding that Dimmedale, a young, sickly minister, is Hester's lover. Hester wishes Chillingworth would take his revenge on her instead of Dimmesdale, and she convinces Dimmesdale to run away with her and Pearl. Later, however, Dimmesdale's guilt drives him to climb the scaffold one night and he confesses to Chillingworth, showing the scarlet letter "A" he has carved on his chest. Shortly afterwards, he dies in Hester's arms. Chillingworth, disillusioned, also dies, and Hester, heartbroken over her loss, leaves town with Pearl.
## About This Selection
This excerpt is from Chapter II, "The Market-Place", of the novel. It begins when Hester Prynne is found guilty of adultery. She has borne a child of her boyfriend and is now led by a town-beadle to leave prison. As a punishment for her sin, she must stand on the scaffolding and be viewed by the townspeople. The Puritan women waiting outside the prison discuss Hester Prynne and her sin. Shortly afterwards, Hester, dignified and beautiful, emerges from the prison. She wears an elaborately embroidered scarlet letter "A" (standing for "adultery") on her breast and carries a three-month-old infant in her arms.

## 纳撒尼尔·霍桑简介

纳撒尼尔·霍桑 (1804-1864) 生于马萨诸塞州塞勒姆，祖籍可追溯至新英格兰的清教徒开拓者。值得一提的是，他的曾祖父是著名的塞勒姆女巫审判案中的一位法官，这段家族历史引发了他内心的矛盾情感，成为他作品中重要的主题之一。1821 年至 1825 年间，霍桑在缅因州布伦瑞克的鲍登学院就读，这段时光也标志着他开始涉足短篇小说创作，其中一部分收入于他的处女作《两次讲述的故事》中。毕业后，他回到塞勒姆度过了接下来的十二年，期间广泛涉猎各类文学作品。在此期间，霍桑问世了《范肖：一个故事》（1828 年），以及超过四十篇故事和素描。1842 年，他和妻子搬迁至康科德的 The Old Manse。他的作品集《两次讲述的故事》第二版问世，1846 年，他的另一力作《古宅里的青苔》也随之亮相。霍桑开始受到评论界的高度赞誉，他被称赞具有“发明、创造力、想象力以及独创性”。1850 年问世的《红字》使他名声大噪，此作深入探讨了“不可饶恕的罪”中人性的扭曲。随后，霍桑陆续推出多部小说，包括《七个尖角楼的房子》（1851 年）以及《幸福谷传奇》（1852 年）。他还为当时的总统富兰克林·皮尔斯撰写了一部传记。1860 年，霍桑出版了《大理石牧神》，这一作品使他成为最早描绘同胞在欧洲经历的美国作家之一，后来的作家如亨利·詹姆斯、威廉·迪安·豪威尔斯和欧内斯特·海明威均延续了这一主题。 霍桑与爱默生、梭罗等超验主义巨匠结下深厚友情。然而，由于沉湎于邪恶、性的危险以及人性虚伪等主题，他无法与超验主义友人们分享他们的乐观与理想主义。霍桑于 1864 年离世，安葬在康科德的沉睡谷公墓中，与好友爱默生及梭罗共眠。
