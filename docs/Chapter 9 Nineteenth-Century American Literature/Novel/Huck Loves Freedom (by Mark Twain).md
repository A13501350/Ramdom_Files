## About Mark Twain

Mark Twain (1835-1910) was born with the name Samuel Langhorne Clemens, in Florida, Missouri. In 1848, Twain was apprenticed to a local printer and later worked as a typesetter for various newspapers. He also wrote sketches and stories. In 1857, he became a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi. Those experiences formed the basis for his Life on the Mississippi (1883) and deepened the Mississippi's influence on his writing thereafter. The outbreak of the Civil War brought his piloting career to an end. He then travelled all over America, paying attention to how people really spoke and what really entertained them. He went to Nevada, reassuming his newspaper career and writing for some literary magazines. Among the essays and stories he wrote during this period, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" quickly won him a national reputation for being a humourist writer and a spokesman for the vanishing American frontier. He left California in 1866 and went east to New York City. He longed to settle in the East for material success but looked nostalgically to the South for his literary sources and to the West for his values. In fact, it was the split between art and business that produced works that appeared inconsistent, contradictory, and careless. In 1873, he published The Gilded Age, his first attempt at an extended work of fiction. Three years later, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) appeared in the publication. He went on writing and, in 1880, published another book, A Tramp Abroad. In 1881, The Prince and the Pauper appeared, and in 1884, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, his most artistic and significant novel, was published. The novel quickly became a best-seller and has become one of the most widely read and taught American novels. Ernest Hemingway famously said, "All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn." Twain took a round-the-world lecture tour in 1895 and continued to write prolifically, producing such books as Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (1896), Tom Sawyer, Detective
(1896), and Following the Equator (1897) and others.

## About The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn

This famous novel by Mark Twain is about a boy named Huck, living in the American South, who escapes his abusive father and journeys down the Mississippi River. On his way, Huck runs into Jim, Miss Watson's slave, who is running away because his master plans to sell him for $800.
Together they travel downriver and soon encounter two raggedly dressed tricksters who claim to be the Duke of Bridgewater and the Dauphin of France. Huck quickly realizes that they are not who they say they are but pretends to believe them for the sake of peace. It goes that these two men turn Jim over to another slave owner. Huck and his friend Tom Sawyer attempt to rescue Jim unsuccessfully. Then it is revealed that Jim's previous owner died, allowing Jim to go free. Huck decides not to return home and to keep wandering instead.
## About This Selection

Presented in the following is an excerpt from the beginning scenes of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884). Readers may immediately feel the presence of both Huck's narrative voice and Twain's voice as the author. 

From the start, Huck speaks to us in a conversational tone that is very much his own, but he also serves as a mouthpiece for Twain. Huck gains an equal status with his author when he mentions "Mr Mark Twain" by name. The first paragraph also conveys Huck's deeper personality. Huck is not just a poor boy with a humorous way of speaking and thinking; he is also a thoughtful young man willing and eager to question the facts of life and facets of human personality. Huck never accepts new ideas without thinking, and he remains untainted by the rules and assumptions of the white society in which he finds himself. Though quick to grumble, Huck is not mean-spirited. He is equally quick to tell us that though the "widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb...she never meant no harm by it."

## 关于马克·吐温

马克·吐温（1835-1910）诞生于密苏里州佛罗里达，原名塞缪尔·朗霍恩·克莱门斯。1848年，吐温起初在当地印刷厂做学徒，后担任多家报纸排字员。此外，他还涉猎素描和故事创作。1857年，他成为密西西比河上一位轮船驾驶员。

这些经历为他的著作《密西西比河上的生活》（1883年）打下了基础，加深了密西西比河对他后续写作的影响。内战的爆发终结了他的驾驶生涯，此后，他周游美国各地，聚焦人们真实的语言和他们所热爱之事。他抵达内华达州，重新踏上新闻事业，为几本文学杂志写稿。在这段时期里，他写下的散文和故事，特别是《卡拉维拉斯县著名的跳蛙》，飞速为他赢得全国赞誉，将他塑造成了幽默作家和美国边疆正在消逝的代言人。1866年，他告别加利福尼亚，前往东部的纽约市。他渴求在东部定居以获取物质上的成功，却怀念着南部的文学资源和西部的价值观。实际上，正是艺术和商业之间的裂痕孕育出那些貌似前后矛盾、自相矛盾且漫不经心的作品。1873年，他问世了《镀金时代》，这是他尝试写长篇小说的首次尝试。三年后，《汤姆索亚历险记》（1876年）在该出版物上问世。他持续创作，并于1880年出版了另一力作《国外流浪记》。1881年，问世《王子与贫儿》，1884年，他最为艺术化和富含意义的作品《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》面市。该作很快便成为畅销书，也是最广泛被阅读和传授的美国小说之一。

欧内斯特·海明威曾言：“所有现代美国文学皆源自马克·吐温的一本书，即《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》。”1895年，马克·吐温展开了环球巡回演讲，并持续创作，出版了《圣女贞德的个人回忆录》（1896年）、《侦探汤姆索亚》（1896年）和《追寻赤道》（1897年）等著作。

## 关于《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》 

马克·吐温的这部著名小说描述了一个名叫哈克的男孩的故事。哈克生活在美国南部，逃离了虐待他的父亲，并沿着密西西比河展开了旅程。在旅途中，哈克邂逅了沃森小姐的奴隶吉姆，他正在逃跑，因为他的主人打算以 800 美元的价格卖掉他。二人飘洋过海，很快就遇到了两个衣衫褴褛的骗子，自称是布里奇沃特公爵和法国王太子。哈克很快发觉他们的真实身份，并决定与他们交朋友以求和平。传闻这两人将吉姆卖给另一个奴隶主。哈克与朋友汤姆索亚试图解救吉姆，但未成功。后来，吉姆的前主人去世，吉姆终于获得了自由。哈克决定不回家，继续漂泊流浪。 

## 关于此选集

以下文字摘自《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》（1884 年）开篇，展现出哈克的叙述方式和吐温的独特声音。一开始，哈克以极具个人风格的对话方式与我们交流，同时也代表吐温表达观点。当哈克谈及“马克·吐温先生”时，彼此地位平等。

首段揭示了哈克更深层次的个性，他不仅仅是一个幽默的穷小子，更是一个有思想的年轻人，渴望挑战生活和人性的方方面面。哈克从不轻易接受新观念，不受周围白人社会规则和假设的束缚。尽管哈克常有牢骚，但他并不狭隘。他也迅速指出，“寡妇略带悲伤地称我为可怜的迷途羔羊……但并非有意伤害我”。
