## About Edgar Allan Poe

Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, a travelling actor, deserted the family in 1810, and his mother, a talented actress, died the following year. He was raised by Allan, his foster father, who later took him to England to attend school. Back in America, he spent a year at the University of Virginia but had to leave because of his problem with gambling, which put him heavily in debt. In 1827, he enrolled in the US Army under the name "Edgar A. Perry". In the next two years, Poe published two collections of his poems without much public notice. Shortly thereafter, Poe entered West Point Military Academy. Poe was discharged from the academy in less than a year for intentionally neglecting his duties. He went to New York, where he published Poems by Edgar A. Poe (1831). After moving to Baltimore in 1831, he began to write short stories for magazines and work as an editor for various newspapers. His first story collection, Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque (1840), contains some of his famous tales, such as "The Fall of the House of Usher". Between 1842 and 1844, Poe published many of his short stories, including "The Masque of the Red Death", "The Pit and the Pendulum", "The Black Cat", and two more detective stories. And in 1845, Poe finally made his name in American letters with his The Raven and Other Poems. Poe left for Richmond in 1849 and delivered a lecture, "The Poetic Principle". Poe died that year in Baltimore, although whether from drinking, heart failure, or other causes was still unclear in the twenty-first century. It is easy to see how Poe's works relate to his uncertain and eventful life experience his works focused on the macabre, the bizarre, and the outcast. The wonder is that he found a way to make striking art from his suffering. Critics acknowledge that Poe developed short fiction as a genre that was to have a major impact on American literature.

## About "The Cask of Amontillado"

This is a horror story by Edgar Allan Poe. It exemplifies the author's "Dark Romanticism", which is a literary sub-genre of English Romanticism, reflecting popular fascination with the irrational, the mystic, the demonic and the grotesque. In this episode, an innocent drunkard is buried alive deep in a bone-packed cellar without knowing what offence he committed against the murderer.
This particular short story is known as Poe's perfect piece. A man named Montresor tells the reader about his revenge against his friend Fortunato, who did him "a thousand injuries". In Italy during Carnival, Montresor tells Fortunato that he has obtained some rare Amontillado wine and invites him back to his cellar to appraise it. After luring the drunken Fortunato into his family's catacombs, Montresor chains Fortunato to a wall and tortures his victim by bricking up a wall to lock him in a dark cell. Fortunato screams, but Montresor only mocks him with louder screaming.
Fortunato's body remains undiscovered for fifty years.
## About This Selection
This episode from the story highlights the horrible time when Montresor lures the drunken Fortunato into his family catacombs and eventually chains him to the wall of a narrow niche, sealing him to die slowly there. Poe is exceptionally skilled in building a horrible aura in a seemingly easygoing description with bitter satire. We, as readers, follow the narrator into the dark of the cellar filled up with bones, and find our hair may stand on end. When we see the despaired Fortunato scream and then die in dead silence, we may be overwhelmed by the tragic sense of this secret murder and the horrible side of human nature.

## 关于埃德加·艾伦·坡

埃德加·艾伦·坡（1809-1849）出生于马萨诸塞州波士顿。他的父亲是一名巡回演员，于1810年抛弃了家庭；他的母亲是一名才华横溢的女演员，次年去世。他由养父艾伦抚养长大，后赴英国求学。回到美国后，他在弗吉尼亚大学度过一年，但因赌博问题而不得不离开，从而负债累累。1827年，他以“埃德加·A·佩里”的名义加入美国陆军。接下来两年里，坡出版了两本诗集，却未引起广泛关注。随后，坡进入西点军校学习，不到一年便因故意疏忽职责被开除。他来到纽约，并出版了一本名为《埃德加·A·坡诗集》的作品（1831年）。 1831年移居巴尔的摩后，他开始写短篇小说为杂志工作，同时担任多家报纸编辑。他的首部短篇小说集《怪诞和阿拉伯式风格的故事》（1840年）收录了一些著名作品，如《厄舍府的倒塌》。在1842年至1844年间，坡发表了多篇短篇小说，包括《红死病的面具》、《陷阱与钟摆》、《黑猫》以及两部侦探小说。1845年，坡凭借《乌鸦和其他诗歌》在美国文学界声誉鹊起。1849年，他前往里士满，并发表了题为《诗意原则》的演讲。坡于当年在巴尔的摩离世，尽管直至21世纪，关于他是酗酒、心力衰竭还是其他原因去世仍没有明确结论。

坡的作品与他不确定且多事的人生经历有着密切联系，专注于恐怖、怪诞和被遗弃者。令人惊讶的是，他找到了一种能从痛苦中产生惊人艺术的方式。评论家们一致认为，坡将短篇小说发展为一种对美国文学产生深远影响的体裁。

## 关于《一桶阿蒙蒂拉多》

这是埃德加·艾伦·坡的一部恐怖小说，体现了作者的“黑暗浪漫主义”，这是英国浪漫主义的一个文学分支，反映了人们对非理性、神秘主义、恶魔和怪诞的迷恋。在这部作品中，一个无辜的醉汉被埋在堆满骨头的地窖深处，却不知道自己对凶手犯下了何等罪行。 这篇短篇小说被誉为坡的完美之作。一个名叫蒙特雷索的人向读者讲述了对朋友福图纳托的报复，因为福图纳托给予了他“千百种伤害”。在意大利狂欢节期间，蒙特雷索告诉福图纳托，他得到了一些罕见的阿蒙蒂拉多葡萄酒，并邀请他回到家族地下墓穴品尝。将醉酒的福图纳托引入墓穴后，蒙特雷索便将其囚禁在墙内，用砖头砌上，将其困于黑暗地牢中，折磨受害者。福图纳托尖叫，而蒙特雷索则嘲笑他的尖叫。 五十年后，福图纳托的尸体仍未被发现。

## 关于此选集


这个故事突出展示了蒙特雷索将醉酒福图纳托引入家族地下墓穴，并最终将其囚禁在狭窄壁龛内，让他在那里慢慢一生，令人胆寒的场面。坡擅长通过生动描述烘托恐怖氛围，且带有尖刻的讽刺。作为读者，我们跟随叙述者踏入充斥骨头的黑暗地窖，发现头皮都竖立起来。当我们见到绝望的福图纳托尖声呼救，最终在死寂中离去时，或许淹没在这起秘密谋杀的悲剧和人性中最可怕的一面之中。
