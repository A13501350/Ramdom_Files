## About Edmund Wilson

Edmund Wilson (1895-1972) is widely regarded as one of the twentieth century's most important American critics, essayists and leading literary journalists. Wilson was born to a distinguished lawyer's family in New Jersey. He attended the Hill School and was active in the school's journal editing and publication. From 1912 to 1916, he studied at Princeton University. After graduation, he became a reporter for the New York Sun. During World War I, he served in the army as a translator. After the war, Wilson moved to New York to become editor of Vanity Fair (1920-1921) and of The New Republic (1926-1931) and book reviewer for The New Yorker (1944-1948).

His first critical work, Axel's Castle (1931), was an important international survey of the Symbolist tradition. In the book, he demonstrated his discerning critical insight, criticizing and praising such writers as W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, Marcel Proust, and James Joyce. Wilson studied Marxism intently to broaden his social criticism, and from Freudian theory, he developed his insight into the human unconscious. And with his voluminous works thereafter, he concerned himself with both literary and social themes and wrote as a historian, poet, novelist, editor, and short-story writer. Unlike some of his contemporaries, such as the New Critics, Wilson thought that a text or topic could be best examined by placing it at the centre of social and ideological contexts, whether biographical, political, social, linguistic, or philosophical. He covered a good variety of subjects, probing each with expansiveness firmly rooted in scholarship and common sense, and he expressed his views in a prose style noted for its clarity and precision. His critical writings on the American novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and William Faulkner attracted public interest to their early works and guided public opinion towards their acceptance.

## About This Selection

The following account of Brooklyn in New York is selected from Wilson's collection of essays, The American Earthquake (1958). In almost 600 pages, the book is a documentary of the American life of the twenties and thirties. It collects nearly a hundred non-literary articles written by Wilson. In the present excerpt, Wilson depicts a gloomy life in the street fraught with a dreaming vision of a banal, stale, hopeless, and monotonous life of the "vulgar" communities in New York.

埃德蒙·威尔逊（1895-1972）被广泛认为是二十世纪最重要的美国批评家、散文家和领先的文学记者之一。威尔逊出生于新泽西州一个著名的律师家庭。他就读于希尔学校，并积极参与学校的期刊编辑和出版。1912年至1916年，他就读于普林斯顿大学。毕业后，他成为《纽约太阳报》的记者。第一次世界大战期间，他在军队担任翻译。战后，威尔逊搬到纽约，成为《名利场》杂志（1920-1921）和《新共和》杂志（1926-1931）的编辑，以及《纽约客》（1944-1948）的书评人。

他的第一部批评作品《阿克塞尔的城堡》（1931）是一次重要的国际性象征主义传统的调查。在书中，他展现了敏锐的批判洞察力，批评和赞扬了W. B. 叶芝、T. S. 艾略特、马塞尔·普鲁斯特和詹姆斯·乔伊斯等作家。威尔逊专心研究马克思主义，以拓宽他的社会批判视野，并从弗洛伊德理论出发，发展了对人类潜意识的洞察力。此后，他创作了大量作品，关注文学和社会主题，并以历史学家、诗人、小说家、编辑和短篇小说作家的身份进行写作。与新批评家等一些同时代人不同，威尔逊认为，最好将文本或主题置于社会和意识形态背景的中心，无论是传记、政治、社会、语言还是哲学。他涉及了各种各样的主题，以扎根于学术和常识的广泛性来探究每一个主题，并以清晰和精确的散文风格表达自己的观点。他对欧内斯特·海明威、F·斯科特·菲茨杰拉德和威廉·福克纳等美国小说家的批评文章引起了公众对他们早期作品的兴趣，并引导公众舆论接受他们的作品。 

关于本选集： 以下关于纽约布鲁克林的叙述选自威尔逊的散文集《美国地震》（1958年）。这本书近600页，是一部20世纪20年代和30年代美国生活的纪录片。它收集了威尔逊撰写的近百篇非文学文章。在本选集中，威尔逊描绘了街头的阴郁生活，充满了对纽约“庸俗”社区平庸、陈腐、绝望和单调生活的幻想。
## Selected Text

**Life in Brooklyn in the Thirties**

In Brooklyn, in the neighborhood of Henry Street, the pleasant red and pink brick houses still worthily represent the generation of Henry Ward Beecher'; but an eternal Sunday? is on them now; they seem sunk in a final silence. In the streets one may catch a glimpse of a solitary well-dressed old gentleman moving slowly a long way off; but in general the respectable have disappeared and only the vulgar survive. The empty quiet is broken by the shouts of shrill Italian children and by incessant mechanical pianos in dingy apartment houses, accompanied by human voices that seem almost as mechanical as they. At night, along unlighted streets, one gives a wide berth to drunkards that sprawl out across the pavement from the shadow of darkened doors; （街上传来意大利務民的孩子的喊声和尖叫声，那些脏分兮的公寓房里没完没了地飘出单调的钢琴声，其中夹杂着同样乏味的说语声。打破了这空荡满的寂静。夜幕下，街道上一路都沒有照明，也不知会从哪个明暗的门洞里冒出群醉鬼，摊开手脚躺在人行道上。这时人们必须离他们远点儿）and I have known a dead horse to be left in the road-two blocks from the principal post office and not much more from the Borough Hall-with no effort made to remove it, for nearly three weeks. In the summer, warm sickening fumes from a factory that makes cheap chocolate give a stagnancy of swamps to the heavy air. In the evening, an old woman steals through the streets, softly calling to cats, which she poisons and which die slowly of gripes in the areas of decorous' houses from which the families have moved away.（夜里，只见一个老妇人暖手蹑脚穿过几条街，轻声呼唤出一群猫，然后给它们喂毒药，让它们在抽搐中慢慢死去。周围都是高雅的住宅，原来的住户都已经搬走。）

So much for the dead and the dying; in the newer part of town, the East Forties, looking down from a high upper window, one takes account of the monstrous carcass' of the Grand Central Station and Palace, with its myriad skylights and its zine-livid roofs, stretched out like a segmented seaworm that is almost unrecognizable as a form of life. Beyond it rise the upright rectangles of drab or raw yellow brick-yellows devoid of brilliance, browns that are never rich— perforated, as if by a perforating machine, with rows of rectangular windows; the stiff black fingers of factories: blunt truneated meaningless towers; a broken scrambling of flat roofs and sharp angles which is yet a compact fitting-in; and then the lead-silver river strung across with its skeletal bridge. In the middle distance, the sky itself seems to be overdisplaced like a pool in which a large safe has been dropped by a disagreeably colored hotel, brownish yellow like a bronchial troche? and so immense that its cubic acres seem to weigh down the very island, almost to make it sag. A flock of pigeons that fly below have the look, in the dull light, of wastepaper blown by the wind.

Sitting indoors in New York by day, one becomes aware of mysterious noises: the drilling of granite teeth, the cackling of mechanical birds, the thudding of Cyclopean iron doors; accelerating avalanches of brick, the collapse of deserted warehouses; explosives that cause no excitement, pistol shots that are quite without consequence. Nor does one care to find out what these noises are. One goes on with whatever one is doing, incurious and wholly indifferent.（在纽约，白天坐在屋子里时，会听到各种怪异的噪声：刺耳的电钻钻墙的声音，呆鸟的咕声，厚重大铁门关闭时发出的闷响；砖垛溃落的哗啦，废弃库倒塌的轰然；无人欢的爆炸，几乎造不成什么后果的枪声。这些噪声到底是什么，没有人在乎。人们该做什么做什么，此外别无兴趣，彻底地漠然。）

Life in Brooklyn in the Thirties 

在布鲁克林的亨利街区，那些宜人的红砖和粉红砖房，依旧堪称亨利·沃德·比彻时代的代表，但如今它们仿佛沉浸在永恒的周日之中；宛如陷入最终的宁静。在街上，或许会看到远远一个穿着整洁的老绅士慢慢前行；但总的来说，那些体面之人已经不见踪影，只有粗俗之辈依然生存。空旷的宁静被尖叫着的意大利孩子们的喧闹打破，以及脏兮兮的公寓楼里不停传来的机械钢琴声，伴随着几乎和机械一样的人声。夜幕降临，漆黑的街道上，人们会远离那些倒在人行道上的醉汉，从黑暗门洞中伸出。我曾经见过一匹死马被遗弃在距离主要邮局两个街区不远处、距离自治市厅也不远的马路上，三周之久也无人清理。夏日里，由一家生产廉价巧克力的工厂飘来的令人作呕的暖气，使得空气中充满了沼泽的凝固感。黄昏时分，一位老妇人悄悄穿行在街道上，轻声呼唤着猫咪，她会毒死这些猫，它们最终将在高贵住宅区的院子里默默抽搐而亡，这些住宅区早已空无一人。 

谈论死亡和垂死者就说这么多吧；在这座城镇的新区域，东四十街，从高高的窗户往下望去，可以看到巨大的中央车站和皇宫那失色的多重天窗和死灰色的屋顶，它们横亘其中，犹如一个分段的海蠕虫，几乎让人难以认出其生命形态。它的后面是直立的方砖建筑，沉闷无光的黄砖，从不富丽夺目的深褐色，被一排排矩形窗穿透，仿佛是被一个穿孔机制所穿过；还有僵硬的黑色工厂的指头状建筑；钝圆截无意义的塔楼；一片破碎的平顶和尖角交错混合，却构成了一个紧凑的融入；再往前是横跨其上的铅灰色河流，被一座骨架桥梁串联。在中远的距离，天空本身仿佛被过度挪移，就像一个大保险箱掉进了一个令人不快的色调酱旅馆中，那酱色黄褐色的巨无霸几乎让立方英亩感觉压迫着整个岛屿，几乎让其下垂。在暗淡的光线中，飞翔的鸽子看起来像是风吹拂下的废纸。 

白天坐在纽约室内，人会意识到各种神秘的噪音：大理石牙齿的钻削声，机械鸟的咯咯声，狰狞的铁门砰砰声；砖块的迅速崩塌，无人的仓库的倾圮；即便爆破声也不引起兴奋，毫无影响的枪声。人们也不愿意去了解这些噪音是什么。人们继续自己的所作所为，漠不关心，毫不好奇。
