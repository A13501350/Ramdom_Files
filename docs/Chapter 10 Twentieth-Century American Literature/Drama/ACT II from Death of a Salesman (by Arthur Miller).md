## About Arthur Miller

Arthur Miller (1915-2005) was born in New York. When his father's firm failed in 1929, the family moved to Brooklyn. Young Miller grew up during the Great Depression, which he saw as a systemic failure and a generation's tragedy. The grim social reality of the time made Miller probe into individuals relations to their work and the price they had to pay for success. 

At the University of Michigan, Miller wrote plays that won him various awards. In 1947, Miller achieved his first success with All My Sons. This play tells the tragedy of Joe Keller, who kills himself due to guilt over causing the death of others because of his business failure. In 1949, Death of a Salesman established Miller as a significant American playwright. In response to the repressive climate of the 1950's Cold War and hectic McCarthyism, Miller wrote The Crucible (1953). This play connects the witch hunts of seventeenth-century Salem with the hunt for Communists of the 1950s.
According to Miller, The Crucible is his most frequently produced work both in the United States and abroad. After a brief period of turbulence in his personal life during the mid-1950s, Miller returned to the American stage and produced many plays of various themes and social settings.

These plays continued to examine personal relationships in light of social criticism. Miller's plays examine the psychological and sociological dimensions of his troubled characters. His heroes are common men who relentlessly pursue their convictions or illusions. Miller's plays confront contemporary moral dilemmas and focus on people's responsibility to be true to themselves and be a part of the human race. In doing so, Miller employs a variety of dramatic forms, including flashbacks, stream-of-consciousness monologues, direct narration, and dynamic symbols. His concern with the struggle to define oneself in a troubled world has made him a popular American playwright and has also gained him a worldwide reputation.

## About Death of a Salesman

This is a play with "two acts and a requiem", depicting "the tragedy of a man who gave his life, or sold it" in pursuit of the American Dream. The play tells the story of Willy Loman, a travelling salesman, who realizes after many years on the road that he has been a failure as a father and a husband. His sons, Happy and Biff, are not successful. With his career fading, Willy escapes into persistent hallucinations, and relives his past, trying to discover the reasons for his failure. Unable to accept failure, he pressures Biff into far-fetched business schemes and, after a bitter quarrel with Biff, commits suicide to leave his sons the legacy of his insurance. 

The play premiered on Broadway in February 1949, running for 742 performances. In 1966, it was broadcast to seventeen million viewers in a television production. In 1975, it was successfully produced at the Circle in the Square. In 1984, it returned to Broadway, and a new television production of the play in 1985 was available for a vast number of viewers. The play has further been acclaimed and produced around the world. Arthur Miller documented an unprecedented Chinese production in his book Salesman in Beijing (1984). The play still appears in most college anthologies and continues to be taught as an American classic.

## About This Selection

The following excerpt is from Act Il of Auther Miller's Death of a Salesman. It represents a climactic scene of the play. Willy quarrels with his son Biff who tells him that they are no great men but "a dime a dozen", and they are both deceived by the American Dream. Biff stresses that he is a failure because he is not smart and is not liked. He doesn't have the ability to "make it", and his father's expectations have only marred his life. Finally, Biff collapses, sobbing, at his father's feet. After Biff leaves, Willy becomes transfixed with delight that Biff does love and will love him despite his financial failure and his infidelity to his wife. He again hallucinates, hearing his elder brother Ben's voice telling him repeatedly to go into the dark jungle and find diamonds. The family retires to bed, leaving Willy alone to compose himself. Then the sound of a car starts as Willy prepares to drive away to his death, and the family's frantic pursuit of him slowly turns into a funeral procession presented in the last "Requiem"
