## About Jack London

Jack London (1876-1916) was born in the slums of San Francisco. His father, a roaming astrologer, left the family before his birth, and his mother married another man. The baby was then given his stepfather's last name, London. Life for young Jack was hard; he had little hope of having a formal education. He had to drop out of school because of poverty. Despite the challenges, he developed a love for reading. He would borrow books from the Oakland Public Library when he could find the time. He worked as an oyster pirate and a seaman, and also travelled across the country as a tramp.

At 19, he was miracus teedely of
California, Berkeley, Afer a year, however, he had to leave for financial reasons. Then he resolved to make a living by writing stories. In 1899, London's tale of the Yukon, "To the Man on the Trail", was found in print. Within five years from then, London published more than one hundred stories and eight full-length volumes. In 1903, The Call of the Wild appeared, which was to become an American classie. In the following years, London's novels followed one upon another with amazing rapidity. He was at once an individualist and a socialist. His The Sea-Wolf
(1904) deals with the high adventure of an individual in nature unencumbered by civilization, while his The Iron Heel (1908) describes the growing class consciousness of the downtrodden masses under a powerful leader. His novel Martin Eden (1909) is frankly autobiographical, and most of his novels reflect aspects of the author's own character and ideals. 

After he became known and wealthy, London led an extravagant life, often spending more than he carned. By his late thirties, his health had begun to fail, partly because of his heavy drinking. He also suffered from rheumatism and digestive ailments and smoked heavily. He died young, at the age of forty.
Jack London was a realistie writer, writing about the human struggle in a hostile environment. His stories are mostly bold, violent, and sometimes primitive, narrated in a language that gives depth to his stories with a remarkable sense of irony.

## About The Call of the Wild

This adventure novel is Jack London's best-known literary work. It was inspired by his experiences as a young man. The novel tells about Buck, who is half St. Bernard and half sheepdog. Buck is kidnapped and sold as a sledge dog to men seeking out gold in Canada. On the sledge team are other dogs, like Dolly, Pike, Joe, Teek, and Koona. Over the following weeks, the rivalries within the pack help Buck recover some of his wild instincts. His rivalry with Spitz, the fierce lead dog, intensifies. Eventually, Buck kills Spitz and becomes the new lead dog. The sledge team is sold again to three Americans whose cruelty and greed result in the death of several dogs and, finally, their own death in an icy river. Buck then meets Thornton, his new master, who is kind and caring but is killed by a tribe of natives. Buck kills several men in vengeance and wanders back into the wild, looking for the wolf pack to join them. He encounters a hostile group of wolves and after a fight, is accepted to follow them into the woods.
## About This Selection

The episode below is from Chapter Ill of The Call of the Wild. It shows how, gripped by his pride of being a powerful dog who must lead, Buck constantly challenges the authority of Spitz, the lead dog. It also shows the hard work the dogs have to endure in the areas where people seek their opportunities in the Gold Rush. Buck meets the huskies who howl in the freezingly cold night, and Buck is delighted to join them. Such nocturnal howls of the dogs, according to the author, sound like painful songs in defiance of life, a primitive call of the wild.

## 杰克·伦敦的生平 

杰克·伦敦（1876-1916）出生于旧金山的贫民窟。他的父亲是一名流浪占星师，在他出生前就离开了家庭，他的母亲嫁给了另一个男人。后来，这个孩子被赋予了继父的姓氏伦敦。年轻的杰克生活艰难；他几乎不可能接受正规教育。他不得不因为贫穷而辍学。尽管面临挑战，但他还是爱上了读书。只要有时间，他就会从奥克兰公共图书馆借书。他当过牡蛎海盗和水手，还曾作为流浪汉在全国各地旅行。

19 岁时，他住在加州伯克利，但一年后，他因经济原因不得不离开。然后他决定以写故事为生。1899 年，伦敦的育空故事《给路上的人》出版了。此后五年内，伦敦发表了一百多篇短篇小说和八卷全长小说。1903年，《野性的呼唤》问世，成为美国经典。在随后的几年里，伦敦的小说以惊人的速度接连问世。他既是个人主义者，又是社会主义者。他的《海狼》（1904）讲述了一个人在不受文明束缚的大自然中的冒险经历，而他的《铁蹄》（1908）则描述了在强大领导人的统治下，被压迫的群众日益增强的阶级意识。他的小说《马丁·伊登》（1909）坦率地说是自传，他的大部分小说都反映了作者自己的性格和理想。

在出名和富裕之后，伦敦过着奢侈的生活，经常入不敷出。到三十多岁时，他的健康状况开始恶化，部分原因是他酗酒。他还患有风湿病和消化系统疾病，吸烟成瘾。他英年早逝，年仅四十岁。 杰克·伦敦是一位现实主义作家，描写了人类在恶劣环境中的挣扎。他的故事大多大胆、暴力，有时甚至很原始，用一种语言叙述，使他的故事具有深刻的讽刺意味。

## 《野性的呼唤》概述 

《野性的呼唤》是杰克·伦敦最著名的文学作品之一，灵感来源于他年轻时的经历。小说描绘了巴克的故事，一只拥有圣伯纳和牧羊犬血统的狗。巴克被绑架卖给了在加拿大淘金的人作为雪橇犬。雪橇队中有其他狗，如多莉、派克、乔、蒂克和库纳。在接下来的故事中，狗群内部的竞争帮助巴克重新找回了一些野性。他与凶猛的领头犬斯皮茨之间的竞争日益激烈。最终，巴克杀死斯皮茨，成为新的领头犬。随后，雪橇队被卖给了三个美国人，他们的残忍和贪婪导致几只狗的死亡，自身最终也葬身冰河。巴克后来遇到了仁慈又有爱心的新主人桑顿，但桑顿却被土著部落所杀。巴克为了复仇杀死了几人，然后回到野外，寻找并加入一只狼群。他面对一群敌对的狼，经过一场激战后，被允许跟随它们进入森林。 

## 对于这段情节的选择

这段情节摘自《野性的呼唤》第三章，生动展示了巴克如何受到领导者身份的自豪感所束缚，不断挑战领头狗斯皮茨的权威。它也展示了在寻找淘金机会的地区，狗们必须忍受的严苛工作。巴克遇到在寒冷夜晚嚎叫的哈士奇，而他很高兴加入他们。作者认为，这些夜间的狗嚎叫听起来像是生命中对抗的痛苦之歌，是野性的原始呼唤。
