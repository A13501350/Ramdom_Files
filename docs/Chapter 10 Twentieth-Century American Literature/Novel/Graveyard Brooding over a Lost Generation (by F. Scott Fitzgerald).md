## About F. Scott Fitzgerald
F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) is considered one of America's most celebrated authors of the twentieth century. With a poetic style and an insight into the fallacies of the American Dream, he created some of the most distinctively American fiction. Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1913, Fitzgerald enrolled at Princeton University but did not complete his study since the country entered World War I, and he joined the army in 1917. 

After the war, Fitzgerald began working for an advertising agency in 1919 but soon returned to St. Paul to live with his parents while revising his novel. A few months later, his autobiographical novel This Side of Paradise (1920) was published. In 1924, Fitzgerald and his wife made their second trip to Europe. In Paris, he met Gertrude Stein and other American expatriate writers and became a close friend of then-unknown Ernest Hemingway. 

Fitzgerald's masterpiece, The Great Gatsby (1925), is one of the most widely read American novels, but this poetic book about love, wealth, innocence, illusions, corruption, and the American Dream was, ironically, a failure when it first appeared, and did not sell many copies. However, the genius of this almost-perfect novel was recognized by many serious readers, including T. S. Eliot (see page 458 of this book), who wrote that "it seems to me to be the first step that American fiction has taken since Henry James". Almost a decade passed before Fitzgerald's next novel, Tender Is the Night (1934), appeared. Drawn much from his life experience, this novel represents the disintegration of fragile Americans living on the French Riviera. It is considered a dreamy elegy to the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's novels are renowned for their graceful prose, psychological acumen, and heartrending awareness of the fragility of the American Dream. Readers also admire Fitzgerald's fiction for its serious moral and philosophical insights.

## About This Side of Paradise

Widely reviewed, the book was praised for its fresh depiction of America's youth, centred on a college student's coming of age.

## About This Selection

In this excerpt from This Side of Paradise, Amory Blaine, a thinly veiled Fitzgerald himself, wanders into a graveyard, brooding the meaning of life. It seems that Fitzgerald is trying to understand his own past through Amory. Note how the grim images of death in the graveyard are contrasted with the new, idealistic generation studying at the university, who will grow up "to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken". In other words, they will become a
"lost generation".
