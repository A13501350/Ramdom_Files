## About William Faulkner
William Faulkner (1897-1962) was the eldest son in his family. He received a desultory education but taught himself, taking his grandfather as his role model and developing a tenacious determination to pursue his career. As a young man, he liked to remain isolated, detached and observant, a personal character that would later serve him well as a writer. At 28, Faulkner met Sherwood Anderson (see page 479 of this book), whose encouragement and recommendation launched young Faulkner into his career as a writer. 

In 1927 Faulkner completed his Flags in the Dust (1973), a long, densely populated work about the aristocratic Sartoris family in mythical Yoknapatawpha County. His next work was his first masterpiece, The Sound and the Fury (1929), a dense, sometimes difficult, but powerful work dealing with a sense of loss and a longing for the past. The publication of Light in August (1932) deepened and expanded the Yoknapatawpha saga.

It was Faulkner's first major meditation on the tangled relationships between blacks and whites in the South. Absalom, Absalom!, another of Faulkner's masterpieces, appeared in 1936. The novel is his most dense and compact work, taking titanic events from the past and recounting them through multiple narrators in the present. For the next six years, he published four more novels: The Unvanquished (1938), drawn together from short stories; The Wild Palms (1939); The Hamlet (1940), which was the first of a trilogy dealing with the Snopes family; and Go Down, Moses (1942). 

Faulkner won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. In the following years, he went on writing and published more works. While Faulkner wrote mostly about life in the South, his work has had an immeasurable effect on American literature. He wrote his greatest novels with themes and characters that resonate with readers of various backgrounds through his knowledge and recreation of a specific place, the American South. He was a master narrator with the humour of frontier American literature, particularly gifted in using language, making it powerful, cadenced, hypnotically rhetorical to his American audience.

## About "A Rose for Emily"

Published in 1930, "A Rose for Emily" is one of Faulkner's most popular southern gothic stories.

The event is set in Jefferson, a town in the American South. Miss Emily Grierson dies, and everyone in the town attends her funeral. A relic of the Southern gentry, she lives in her house alone for thirty-two years, her interactions with the wider community curtailed by her aloof, noble father. After her father's death, Emily is seen in the company of a lower-class Northerner, Homer Barron. It is rumoured that they are engaged. Then Homer vanishes from public view. Emily lives alone for the rest of her life, seldom seen out of her house. The townspeople explore Emily's house after her funeral and find a man's skeleton in her bed suspected to be Homer Barron's.

## About This Selection

Below is Section I of "A Rose for Emily". Emily, the last member of the aristocratic Grierson family, dies. For all the men of the town, she is a "fallen monument". For most women, the inside of her large house is a source of curiosity and gossip. The townspeople have viewed her as a "hereditary obligation upon the town" ever since a previous mayor remits her taxes. The younger generation of politicians come to pay Emily a respected visit to her house. They attempt to get her to pay her taxes, but she refuses, telling them to "see Colonel Sartoris", the mayor who died many years ago. Notice how the author portrays Emily's cold and peremptory attitude towards her young visitors, and how these "modern" officials are "vanquished" by Emily's "noble carriage"


## 威廉·福克纳的故事 

威廉·福克纳 (1897-1962) 是家中的长子，他接受了散漫的教育，但自学成才，并以祖父为榜样，培养起了追求事业的坚定决心。年轻时，他喜欢保持孤立、超脱和观察力强，这种性格对他后来成为一名作家大有裨益。

在 28 岁时，福克纳遇见了舍伍德·安德森 (Sherwood Anderson)，他的鼓励和推荐让年轻的福克纳踏上了作家之路。 1927 年，福克纳完成了篇幅长、内容密集的作品《尘埃中的旗帜》，讲述了神秘的约克纳帕塔法县的贵族萨托里斯家族。紧随其后的《喧哗与骚动》(1929) 是他的第一部杰作，内容密集、有力，探讨了失落感和对过去的怀念。《八月之光》(1932) 的出版深化并扩展了约克纳帕塔法传奇。这是福克纳首次深入探讨南方黑人和白人之间错综复杂的关系。1936 年面世的另一部杰作《押沙龙，押沙龙！》是他最密集、最严谨的作品，采用多个叙述者，选取过去重要事件进行叙述。接下来的六年间，他又相继出版了四部小说：《不败者》（1938）、《野棕榈》（1939）、《哈姆雷特》（1940）、三部曲的第一部，以及《去吧，摩西》(1942)。 

1949 年，福克纳荣获诺贝尔文学奖。在随后的几年中，他继续写作并发表更多作品。尽管福克纳主要描绘的是南方生活，但他的作品对美国文学具有深远影响。他创作了众多伟大小说，作品主题和人物通过对美国南部特定地域的了解和再现，引起了不同背景读者的共鸣。他是一位杰出的叙事者，富有美国边疆文学的幽默感，尤其擅长运用语言，使其小说对美国读者产生强烈、富有节奏、具有催眠效果的修辞效果。
