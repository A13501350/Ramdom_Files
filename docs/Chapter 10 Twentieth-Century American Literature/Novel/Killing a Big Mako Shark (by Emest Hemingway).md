## About Ernest Hemingway

Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) was born into an upper-middle-class family in Illinois.
Following his father, who had a great interest in hunting and fishing, young Ernest grew to be an outdoorsman and an enthusiastic sportsman. He completed high school in 1917, just as the United States was being drawn into World War I. He was eager to serve his country in the war. In 1918, he left for Italy as a Red Cross ambulance driver. Soon he was wounded, yet despite his wounds, he saved an injured soldier. For this act of heroism, he was very much adored as a war hero.

Then he went to Paris, where he was to stay for a decade, coming to know well such influential literary figures as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and James Joyce. He began working on his short stories and a novel about the "lost generation". Hemingway's first novel, The Sun Also Rises (1926), established his name as an author. Three years later, his A Farewell to Arms (1929) was published. In the years to come, Hemingway became a rugged outdoorsman who spent much time attending bullfights in Spain, hunting in Africa, and fishing in Florida. These experiences served as inspiration for books like Death in the Afternoon (1932), an extended discourse on bullfighting, and Green Hills of Africa (1935). Hemingway's next novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), is a reflection on the cost of conflict and a call for the unity of humankind.
After World War II, he published The Old Man and the Sea (1952), which won him the Pulitzer Prize in 1953, and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. Hemingway began to suffer increasingly from depression and anxiety after World War II, and he ended his life by shooting himself with a shotgun. 

Ernest Hemingway played a major role in shaping the twentieth-century American literature. His works demonstrate courage, masculinity, careful control, close observation, accurate depiction, and the highest level of artistic integrity. At a time when much writing was florid and verbose, Ernest Hemingway dealt with complex thoughts and emotions with simplicity of expression.

## About The Old Man and the Sea

This masterpiece by Hemingway tells about an old but tough and admirable Cuban fisherman, Santiago, over the course of three days at the sea. Santiago goes far out to sea alone on his skiff and hooks a giant marlin. His small boat is pulled farther offshore by the fish. After a protracted struggle, the old man finally overpowers the fish and lashes it to the side of his boat. However, the blood in the water quickly draws hungry sharks. The old man fights the sharks to defend his catch, killing the biggest. By nightfall of the second day, the sharks have ripped the marlin to pieces. All the old man can do is steer his boat towards the lights of Havana. Upon reaching the shore, the old man falls several times from exhaustion. At the pier, his fellow fishermen marvel at the skeleton of the giant fish. The novel ends as the old man falls asleep, dreaming of lions.

## About This Selection

The following excerpt is from the second half of The Old Man and the Sea. It shows how, on the third day, the exhausted old man sees sharks begin to appear. They are attracted by the big fish's blood and surface from deep water to prey. A large Mako shark soon attacks and rips a huge chunk of flesh from the catch; but with great courage and strength, the old man kills the shark with his last harpoon. In this excerpt, Hemingway lets his character express his famous motto: "A man can be destroyed but not defeated."
