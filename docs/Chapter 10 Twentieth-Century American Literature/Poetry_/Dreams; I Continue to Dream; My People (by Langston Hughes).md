## About Langston Hughes

Langston Hughes (1902-1967) was born in Missouri. He was raised by his mother and grandmother, who told him stories about black people's heroic quest for freedom, liberty and justice. In high school, Hughes read voraciously and developed a keen interest in poetry, music, and art. His early poem "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" was published in The Crisis in 1921. With his experiences in Harlem, his intimate sense of the joys and agonies of his fellow African Americans, and his love for the music and mood of the African American language, Hughes created some of his most enduring works. In 1926, Hughes published his first book of verse, The Weary Blues. The poems in the collection conveyed the musical and heated nightlife of Harlem, as well as the agonies of racial conflict and poverty. One year after he enrolled in Lincoln University, his second volume of poetry, Fine Clothes to the Jew 1927), appeared. This book contained poems depicting the harsh, often violent underside of Harlem life. Hughes was a versatile writer who also produced short stories, plays, operas and autobiographies. His most outstanding achievement, however, was in poetry. Collections such as Montage of a Dream Deferred (1951) pictured a Harlem life that had changed drastically from its renaissance years of jazz and vibrant life in the 1920s and 1930s to a postwar ghetto of violence and blighted poverty.
The poems in Ask Your Mama: Twelve Moods for Jazz (1961) explored the issue of segregation and other racial issues. Stylistically, the smooth rhythms of the blues that permeated his earlier poetry were often replaced by angular rhythms of sharp contrast. Hughes was a very prolific writer in almost all genres of writing. Aside from volumes of poetry collections, he published many novels and short stories, as well as plays and books for children. He also published two autobiographies in 1940 and 1956. These works made up an integral part of the Harlem Renaissance, an intellectual and cultural revival of African American music, dance, art, fashion, literature, theatre, politics and scholarship centred in Harlem, Manhattan, lasting from 1910s through the 1930s. All in all, Hughes' poetry is charged with life and love. He was a poet who loved life and loved his heritage. More than any other African American writer, Hughes captured the essence of the complexity of a life where laughter and tears, joy and frustration interweave, and people still manage to sing and dance with the spirit of humanity.

## 关于兰斯顿·休斯 

兰斯顿·休斯 (1902-1967) 生于密苏里州。在母亲和祖母的呵护下长大，而她们讲述的黑人为自由、解放和正义奋斗的故事深深影响着他。年少时，休斯饥渴地阅读，对诗歌、音乐和艺术充满浓厚兴趣。他的早期诗歌《黑人谈起河流》于 1921 年在《危机》杂志上发表。凭借对哈莱姆经历的感悟、对黑人同胞欢乐和痛苦的深情体验，以及对黑人语言音乐与情感的热爱，休斯创作出一系列经典之作。1926 年，休斯出版首部诗集《疲惫的蓝调》。其中的诗歌传达了哈莱姆的音乐与热情夜生活，以及人种冲突与贫困之苦。随后一年进入林肯大学，他发表第二部诗集《犹太人的精美衣服》（1927 年），书中描绘了哈莱姆生活之残酷，经常暴力阴暗一面。休斯才华横溢，智慧过人，涉猎广泛，创作领域不仅限于短篇小说、戏剧、歌剧和自传，然而，其诗歌成就最为卓著。《被推迟的梦想的蒙太奇》（1951 年）等诗集描绘了哈莱姆的生活，从 20 世纪 20 年代和 30 年代的爵士乐复兴与生机勃勃的生活，到战后充满暴力与贫困的贫民区，生活发生翻天覆地的变化。《问问你的妈妈：十二种爵士乐情绪》（1961 年）中的诗篇探讨了人种隔离与其它人种议题。

在风格上，他的早期诗歌中蓝调的流畅节奏常被鲜明对比的锐利节奏所取代。休斯在各类创作中皆是多产作家。除诗集外，他出版了众多小说和短篇故事，还有戏剧和儿童读物。于 1940 年与 1956 年出版两部自传，这些作品构成哈莱姆文艺复兴的重要一环。哈莱姆文艺复兴，源自 1910 年代，延续至 1930 年代，是一场围绕曼哈顿哈莱姆区展开的非裔美国人音乐、舞蹈、艺术、时尚、文学、戏剧、政治与学术等思想与文化复兴。总而言之，休斯的诗歌洋溢着生机与爱。他是一位热爱生活、传统的诗人。相较其他非裔美国作家，休斯更能捕捉到生活复杂性的本质，生活中的欢笑与泪水、喜悦与失落纠缠在一起，但人们依然能以人性精神高歌舞蹈。
