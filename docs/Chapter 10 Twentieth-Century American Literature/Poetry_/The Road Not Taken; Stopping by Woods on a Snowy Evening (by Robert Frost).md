## About Robert Frost

Robert Frost (1874-1963) was born in San Francisco, where he spent his childhood. At 21, he married and then attended Harvard for a short time. After living on a farm with limited success, Frost took the family to England in 1912 and settled in a rural village, where he devoted his time to poetry. He published his first collection, A Boy's Will, in 1913. The book was praised by poet Ezra Pound, who helped establish Frost's reputation. Frost, however, was not content with Pound's style, and he wanted to follow his own way. One year later, Frost published his second book of poems, North of Boston (1914), which included such important poems as "The Death of the Hired Man" and "After Apple-Picking". With these books, he went back to America, settled with his family on a farm, and set about establishing his reputation as a poet. Frost's third book of poetry, Mountain Interval, was published in 1916. It was well received and contained some of Frost's best and most typical poems such as "The Road Not Taken" and "The Oven Bird". His poems were beginning to develop a subtle structure that his early poems did not have. In 1923, Frost published New Hampshire. It contained some of his best poems, including "The Need of Being Versed in Country Things", "To Earthward", and "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening". The book received the 1924 Pulitzer Prize. Another book of poems, West-Running Brook, appeared in 1928, followed by his Collected Poems in 1930, which won the Pulitzer Prize for a second time. Despite his family difficulties, Frost continued to receive honours for his poetry. In 1931, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He published more collections of poetry, winning two more Pulitzer Prizes. Robert Frost is important because he presented himself as a simple and rural poet and seldom revealed the complexity and darkness within. He maintained traditional metre, structure, and themes during a time when modernism was the dominant poetic mode. His style was plain, but his poetic structures were complex.

## About This Selection

In this selection, you will read two of Robert Frost's most famous poems. The first one "The Road Not Taken" uses the extended metaphor of a traveller in the woods to explore the impacts of decisions one makes in life. The metaphor of the diverged road immediately evokes the idea of a journey of all individuals' choices in their lives among many alternatives from which they must choose one. Once a decision is made, there is no turning back, and one has to accept the consequences of the choice. The second poem in this selection, "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening", is a highly symbolic lyric with dramatic narration. The poem's speaker stops to watch the snow falling through the trees and considers the darkness and the journey ahead. He is lured by the peacefulness and beauty of nature. Yet he hesitates, held back by the promises he must keep. The poet uses imagery, connotation, and repetition to create a tension between nature's peacefulness and an individual's obligation in life.

罗伯特·弗罗斯特 (1874-1963)，他的故事始于旧金山。年轻时结婚，并在哈佛大学短暂求学。尝试过农场生活却无成就，于 1912 年携家人移居英国乡村，专注于诗歌创作。

1913 年，问世《男孩的意志》，受到埃兹拉·庞德点赞。然而，弗罗斯特渴望寻找自己的道路。一年后，推出《波士顿以北》（1914 年），包含《雇工之死》和《摘苹果之后》等经典之作。携此归国，与家人定居农场，闯出诗人之名。1916 年，《山间间歇》出版，备受称赞，内收《未选择的路》及《烤箱鸟》等佳作。其作品延伸早期诗歌无可比拟的微妙结构。1923 年，《新罕布什尔》问世，内含诸多佳作，如《熟悉乡村事物的需要》、《走向大地》和《雪夜林边驻足》。1924 年普利策奖花落囊中。1928 年问世《西流溪》，继而《诗集》（1930 年）再度斩获普利策奖。虽遭家庭困顿，弗罗斯特以诗歌赢誉继续。1931 年当选美国艺术与科学学院院士。出版更多诗集，再度蝉联两次普利策奖。
