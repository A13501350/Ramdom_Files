## About T. S. Eliot

T. S. Eliot (in full Thomas Steams Eliot, 1888-1965) was descended from a distinguished New England family. He was born and lived his carly life in St. Louis, but Eliot knew carly that regardless of where he lived, he was a New Englander. Eliot enrolled at Harvard University from 1906 to 1909. He stayed on as a graduate student and was much influenced by French Symbolists. In 1914, he continued his study at Merton College, Oxford.

As the war was imminent, he had to stay in England, where he met Ezra Pound, who became the most important literary influence in his life. With Pound's help, Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" was published in 1915 in Poetry, and two ycars later, his first book, Prufrock and Other Observations, was published, followed by Ezra Pound: His Metric and Poetry (1917). By his fortieth birthday, Eliot had 23 more books in print, including collections of his poetry, several books of criticism that dislocated many conventional ideas of literature. He also had three dramatic works, Sweeney Agonistes
(1932), The Rock (1934), and Murder in the Cathedral (1935). 

The most influential of his books was The Waste Land, published in 1922. The poem deals largely with the question of human alienation and estrangement in the post-World War I era. In a pessimistic tone, the poem depicts humankind's greed and lust, its sense of homelessness and its need and desire for redemption. The poem is characterized by its modernist poetic form, the use of myth to bespeak modern experience; its collage-like juxtaposition of different voices, traditions, and discourses; and its focus on form as the carrier of meaning. Eliot's poems have made him the primary figure of modernist poetry both for his peers and for subsequent generations. 

With the onset of World War II, Eliot wrote more poems than drama, resurrecting "Burnt Norton" (1936) as the first poem of Four Quartets (1943), which also contained "East Coker" (1940), "The Dry Salvages" (1941), and "Little Gidding" (1942). These poems deeply reflect his own past and, by extension, the collective past of the human race. T. S. Eliot's break from the Romantic poets and his conscious experiments with new poetic rhythms that conform to normal speech patterns established him as a pioneering poet who dared to turn from established conventions in both the style and substance of poetry.

## About This Selection

T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land cannot possibly be left out by any anthology of English literature. This 434-line modernist poem presents the modern spiritual barrenness, the despair and depression that followed World War I, the sterility and turbulence of the modern world, and the decline and breakdown of Western culture. Here in this selection, two segments are selected from The Waste Land. In the first segment, the rebirth of the land after the barren winter is depicted with cruel images. In the second segment, the poet gives a vignette of the sordidness of modern life exemplified by a gloomily busy London, which is evocative of what E. M. Forster has envisioned in his Howards End (see page 306 of this book).

## 关于T. S.艾略特

T. S.艾略特（全名Thomas Stearns Eliot，1888-1965）是新英格兰一个显赫家族的后裔。他出生并生活在圣路易斯，但艾略特知道，无论他住在哪里，他都是新英格兰人。艾略特于1906年至1909年就读于哈佛大学。他继续攻读研究生，深受法国象征主义者的影响。1914年，他继续在牛津大学默顿学院学习。 

由于战争迫在眉睫，他不得不留在英国，在那里他遇到了埃兹拉·庞德，后者成为他一生中最重要的文学影响者。在庞德的帮助下，艾略特的《J.阿尔弗雷德·普鲁弗洛克的情歌》于1915年在《诗歌》杂志上发表，两年后，他的第一本书《普鲁弗洛克和其他观察》出版，随后又出版了《艾兹拉·庞德：他的韵律和诗歌》（1917年）。到他四十岁生日时，艾略特已经出版了23本书，包括他的诗集，几本颠覆了许多传统文学观念的评论书。他还有三部戏剧作品，《斯威尼·阿贡斯忒斯》（1932年）、《岩石》（1934年）和《大教堂谋杀案》（1935年）。 

他最具影响力的著作是1922年出版的《荒原》。这首诗主要涉及第一次世界大战后人类异化和疏远的问题。这首诗以悲观的语气描绘了人类的贪婪和欲望、无家可归的感觉以及对救赎的需要和渴望。这首诗的特点是其现代主义的诗歌形式，用神话来表达现代体验；它以拼贴画的方式并置了不同的声音、传统和话语；它注重形式作为意义的载体。艾略特的诗歌使他成为同代人和后代现代主义诗歌的主要人物。 

随着第二次世界大战的爆发，艾略特写的诗比戏剧还多，他复活了《烧毁的诺顿》（1936年）作为《四重奏》（1943年）的第一首诗，其中还包括《东科克》（1940年）、《干涸的打捞物》（1941年）和《小吉丁》（1942年）。这些诗深刻地反映了他自己的过去，并进而反映了人类的集体过去。T. S.艾略特与浪漫主义诗人决裂，有意识地尝试符合正常语言模式的新诗歌节奏，这使他成为一名敢于在诗歌风格和内容上突破既定惯例的先锋诗人。 

## 关于本选集 

任何一本英国文学选集都不可能遗漏T. S.艾略特的《荒原》。这首434行的现代主义诗歌展现了现代精神的荒芜、第一次世界大战后的绝望和沮丧、现代世界的贫瘠和动荡以及西方文化的衰落和崩溃。
本选集从《荒原》中选取了两个片段。在第一片段中，用残酷的画面描绘了荒芜的冬天过后土地的重生。在第二片段中，诗人以繁忙而阴郁的伦敦为代表，描绘了现代生活的肮脏，让人想起E. M.福斯特在《霍华德庄园》中所设想的场景（见本书第306页）。

### The Cruellest Month

```

April is the cruellest month, breeding

四月是最残忍的一个月，荒地上

Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing

长着丁香，把回忆和欲望

Memory and desire, stirring

参合在一起，又让春雨

Dull roots with spring rain.

催促那些迟钝的根芽。

Winter kept us warm, covering

冬天使我们温暖，大地

Earth in forgetful snow, feeding

给助人遗忘的雪覆盖着，又叫

A little life with dried tubers.

枯干的球根提供少许生命。
```

### Unreal City

```
Unreal City,

并无实体的城，

Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,

在冬日破晓的黄雾下，

A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,

一群人鱼贯地流过伦敦桥，人数是那么多，

I had not thought death had undone so many.

我没想到死亡毁坏了这许多人。

Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,

叹息，短促而稀少，吐了出来，

And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.

人人的眼睛都盯住在自己的脚前。

Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,

流上山，流下威廉王大街，

To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours

直到圣马利吴尔诺斯教堂，那里报时的钟声

With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.

敲着最后的第九下，阴沉的一声。
