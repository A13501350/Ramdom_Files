William Bradford **威廉·布拉德福德**，五月花号公约签署人之一，于1620年参与创立了普利茅斯殖民地，并在长达30余年的时间里担任普利茅斯总督。

布拉德福德出生在英格兰约克郡的一个殷实的自耕农家庭，十几岁出头便表现出对稳健派清教教会的宗教同情，十七岁时在他斯克鲁比加入了著名的公理宗分离派教会。

1609年在约翰·罗宾森的带领下，布拉德福德随公理宗教会迁往尼德兰。之后的11年中，布莱德福的与其他清教徒一直居住在莱登，直到他们在被荷兰文化吞并的担忧促使下登上五月花号驶向北美。

1621年他们与一大批反分离主义先民一同到达日后马萨诸塞州的普利茅斯所在地。

在登陆前，公理派的41名成年男性先民共同签署了新世界的第一份社会公约——**《五月花号公约》**。

他所撰写的《普利茅斯垦殖记》(《普利茅斯拓荒记》/《普利茅斯种植园记》)是关于欧洲新世界殖民史的早期著作之一。

  

William Bradford (1590-1657) was born in Yorkshire, England. At age twelve, Bradford started attending religious services of the Separatists who sought reform of the Church of England towards greater simplicity. In 1609 he, with other Separatists, sought refuge in Leyden, Netherlands. The Pilgrims (as the group of Separatists were to be called) were unhappy because they lived as alien people in a strange land. 

In 1617, Bradford was one of the committee members to make arrangements to sail to America. Then on September 16, 1620, the Pilgrims set out gor America on the Mayflower. Bradford was among the 102 persons who crossed the Atlantic and was a signer of the Mayflower Compact in November of 1620 as the ship anchored off the tip of Cape Cod. Bradford led the colonists to settle at Plymouth, Massachusetts. Bradford was elected governor of the colony. 

The colony, however, faced many hardships. But it managed to stand, with the kind help from the nearby Native Americans, who later mostly died off from the white man's diseases. 

Bradford was the author of Of Plymouth Plantation**《普利茅斯垦殖记》**. He worked on it from 1630 to 1651, writing from notes, correspondence, and memory. The history traces the whole Pilgrim story from their English exile to 1647. Bradford was also the coauthor of the promotional tract, Mourt's Relation (1622), and his letters were collected and printed as Governor Bradford's Letter Book (1794). 

Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation exemplifies highest standards of clarity and straightforward prose; at the same time, it is enlivened by an understated humor that modifies the popular image of the Pilgrims. It is regarded as one of the major works of Colonial American literature.

  

  

This excerpt is from William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation. 

After 66 days at sea, the _Mayflower_, with 102 passengers and a crew of about 30, reached America, dropping anchor near the tip of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on November 21, 1620. 

Before setting anchor, the male Pilgrims and non-Pilgrim passengers drew up and signed the Mayflower Compact《五月花号公约》. It is a brief document (about 200 words) that designates that the signers and their family members are bound for the establishment of a self-government and are abide by any laws and regulations "for the general good of the colony". Once they set foot on the land, they faced the problems of survival in the wilderness. In this excerpt, Bradford vividly enumerates his and his fellow colonists' perilous condition.

威廉·布拉德福（William Bradford，1590-1657年）出生在英格兰约克郡。十二岁时，布拉德福开始参加寻求改革英格兰教会朝向更大简朴化的分裂主义者的宗教仪式。1609年，他与其他分裂主义者一起寻求庇护去到荷兰的莱顿。朝圣者们（后来被称为分裂主义者群体）感到不快乐，因为他们生活在一个陌生的土地上。 1617年，布拉德福是一个委员会成员，负责安排前往美洲的航行。然后在1620年9月16日，朝圣者们乘坐五月花号开始了前往美洲的航行。布拉德福是跨越大西洋的102人之一，并在1620年11月五月花号抵达科德角前签署了五月花号公约。布拉德福带领殖民者在马萨诸塞州的普利茅斯定居，并当选为殖民地的总督。 然而，殖民地面临着许多困难。但在附近土著美洲人的友善帮助下，这个殖民地得以建立，后来大多数土著美洲人因白人的疾病而死亡。 布拉德福是《普利茅斯垦殖记》的作者。他从1630年写到1651年，从笔记、信件和记忆中撰写。这部历史追溯了整个朝圣者故事，从他们的英国流亡到1647年。布拉德福还是促销小册子《穆尔特的关系》（1622年）的合著者，他的信件被汇编并印刷为《布拉德福总督的书信集》（1794年）。 布拉德福的《普利茅斯垦殖记》体现出最高的清晰度和直截了当的散文标准；同时，其中夹杂着一种低调的幽默，改变了人们对朝圣者的普遍形象。它被视为殖民地美国文学的重要作品之一。 这一节选摘自威廉·布拉德福的《普利茅斯垦殖记》。 经过66天的航行，五月花号带着102名乘客和约30名船员抵达了美洲，在1620年11月21日靠近马萨诸塞州科德角附近抛锚。 在抛锚前，男性朝圣者和非朝圣的乘客起草并签署了《五月花号公约》。这是一份简短的文件（约200字），规定签署者及其家庭成员将为建立自我管理制度而努力，并遵守“为殖民地的普遍利益”执行任何法律法规。一旦他们踏上陆地，他们就面临着在荒野中生存的问题。在这一节选中，布拉德福生动地描述了他和其他殖民者身处危险境地的情况。

## 【Selected Text】

**People of the Mayflower**

Being thus arrived in a good harbor, and brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of Heaven who had brought them over the fast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all the perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on the firm and stable earth, their proper element1...终于，“五月花”号抵达风平浪静的泊港，安全靠岸。人们长跪不起，感谢上帝保佑他们横渡风高浪急的大洋，度过无尽的危难，再次踏上坚实稳固的大地，回到适合他们生活的环境。But here I cannot but stay and make a pause, and stand half amazed at this poor people's present condition; and so I think will the reader, too, when he well considers the same. Being thus passed the vast ocean, and a sea of troubles before in their preparation (as may be remembered by that which went before), they had now no friends to welcome them nor inns to entertain or refresh their weather-beaten bodies; no houses or much less towns to repairto2, to seek for succour3.

It is recorded in Scripture4 as a mercy to the Apostle5 and his shipwrecked company, that the barbarians showed them no small kindness in refreshing them, but these savage barbarians, when they met with them (as after will appear) were readier to fill their sides full of arrows6 than otherwise. And for the season it was winter, and they that know the winters of that country know them to be sharp and violent, and subject to cruel and fierce storms, dangerous to travel to known places, much more to search an unknown coast. Besides, what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full of wild beasts and wild men—and what multitudes there might be of them they knew not. Neither could they, as it were, go up to the top of Pisgah7 to view from this wilderness a more goodly country to feed their hopes; for which way soever they turned their eyes (save upward to the heavens) they could have little solace or content in respect of any outward objects.

For summer being done, all things stand upon them with a weather-beaten face, and the whole country, full of woods and thickets, represented a wild and savage hue. If they looked behind them, there was the mighty ocean which they had passed and was now as a main bar and gulf to separate them from all the civil parts of the world. 夏天既逝，万物肃杀，树木、荆棘丛生的大地展现出一片荒凉和狂野的景色。他们转身看去，但见他们刚跨越的浩瀚大海，像巨大的裂谷，挡在他们与世界上任何的文明社会之间。If it be said they had a ship to succour them, it is true; but what heard they daily from the master and company? But that with speed they should look out a place (with their shallop8) where they would be, at some near distance; for the season was such that he would not stir from thence till a safe harbor was discovered by them, where they would be, and he might go without danger; and that victuals9 consumed apace but he must and would keep sufficient for themselves and their return. Yea, it was muttered10 by some that if they got not a place in time, they would turn them and their goods ashore and leave them. 

Let it also be considered what weak hopes of supply and succour they left behind them, that might bear up their minds in this sad condition and trials they were under; and they could not but be very small. It is true, indeed, the affections and love of their brethren11 at Leyden12was cordial and entire towards them, but they had little power to help them or themselves; and how the case stood between them and the merchants at their coming away hath already been declared.

当天路客们找到这个避风港，安全踏上眼前这块土地时，他们双膝跪下，向上帝献上赞美的祷告，感谢他帮助他们跨过无边的海洋，穿越狂风巨浪，并将他们带离一切的险阻和悲伤；然后又把他们的双脚放在一片坚实而稳固的土地上，放在正适合他们生存的天地里。


~~难怪他们欣喜若狂，要知道，当年博学多才的塞内卡￼在他的家乡意大利海岸作了一次短途旅行便身染疾病，以至于他发誓宁愿在陆地上旅行20年，也不愿从海路到任何地方去，不管航程有多短，海上航行对他来说实在是既单调乏味，又让人恐惧。~~

在这里，我不得不暂停一下，因这群人目前的可怜处境实在令我惊异，难以置信。我想读者如果细心体察，也会作如此感想。他们跨越了辽阔的大海，还克服了之前准备工作期间遭遇的无穷磨难，到现在既没有朋友来欢迎，也没有旅馆可以休息放松，让憔悴的身心重新振作，更不要说有可居住的房屋、城镇来让他们恢复元气。￼


《圣经·使徒行传》28章里记录了原始部落人群的仁爱之心，他们以极大的善意帮助使徒保罗和他失事船只的同伴。但是在这里，他们看见的却是浑身披满了弓箭的原始部落野蛮人（即将出现）。此时正值冬天，经历过当地冬季的人都知道，那天气是何等的严寒刺骨，经常会遭遇暴风雪，就是去熟悉的地方都很危险，更别说在陌生的海岸摸索前进了。再有，除了一片杳无人烟的荒野及游荡其中的野兽、野人，他们什么也看不到。这里到底有多少野兽、野人，他们也不知道。他们也不可能像摩西那样，登上毗斯迦山顶，透过这荒原远眺理想中的迦南美地￼。无论他们朝哪个方向观望，所看到的东西都无法令他们感到欣慰（除了仰望天空）。

因夏天已经过去，地上万物都经历了季节的变换和风雪的雕琢，森林、灌木满目荒原，呈现出一幅苍茫辽阔的原始图景。朝身后望去，只有那片刚刚渡过的茫茫大海，现在像一道深渊把他们和文明世界分隔开来。有人会说：他们还有一艘船可以用啊！这没错，但你听听船长和水手们每天都对他们说些什么吧。他们需要马上划着小船寻找一处地方，不能离得太远，在这样的气候里，如果找不到可以安全停靠的港口，船长是不能把船靠近海岸的。此时，食品很快就要耗尽，而返航还需要有足够的食品。有水手已经悄声嘀咕说，如果还不尽快找到停靠点，就把他们及行李都丢在岸边，然后开船返航。

还别忘了，启程出发的时候，移民们与商人们之间的情况我前面也已经描述过，要想从英格兰——那个被他们抛在身后的土地得到更多的援助，好让他们在如此恶劣的环境考验中振作精神，这希望是多么渺茫。的确，远在莱顿的弟兄之爱真挚恳切，牢不可摧，但此时的他们，对此也爱莫能助。
