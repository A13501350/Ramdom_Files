Edward Taylor 艾德华·泰勒 (1642-1729)，美洲殖民时期的诗人、牧师和医生。1668考入哈佛大学，1671年毕业后，在马萨诸塞州的一个偏远小镇韦斯特菲尔德担任牧师。
泰勒是北美殖民时期的重要诗人之一，他的诗作体现了宗教精神和诗歌艺术的高度结合，主要诗作有《内省录》(Preparatory Meditations)，《上帝对其选民有影响的决定》(Gods Determinations Touching His Elect)，《诗体基督教史》(Metrical History of Christianity)。

Edward Taylor (c.1642-1729) was probably born in Sketchley, England. He emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts in 1668 and was admitted to Harvard the same year. 
Taylor recorded his voyage across the Atlantic with vivid precision in his Diary—violent storms, different types of fish and sea fowl, and, above all, his fascination with fireflies. The poet's fascination with nature continued in later years, as evidenced by such poems as "Upon a Spider Catching a Fly"《蜘蛛捕获苍蝇有感》and "Upon a Wasp Chilled with Cold"《冷得发抖的黄蜂》, among many others.
After graduating in 1671 from Harvard, Taylor accepted a religious position at Westfield, a remote town in Massachusetts, where he wrote about his doubts and thoughts on his calling as a minister in his private, poetic series. In his fifty-eight years of life as minister and physician, he bore the responsibility of meeting his congregation's medical and spiritual needs, and at the same time, wrote his largest collection of poems "Preparatory Meditations"《内省录》. More than two hundred in number, these devotional poems remained in manuscript, at his own request, and were not published until 1937, when their importance to the history of early American letters, and their own poetic values, were at once recognized. A complete edition of Taylor's works was published in 1960. 
At the time when English poetry was moving into a century of neoclassicism, Taylor was writing verse in the metaphysical mode of John Donne, characterized by complex syntax, striking conceits, and intimate, direct address. In addition, Taylor's poetic style is also characterized by his meditative technique, his coordinating private poetic thoughts with public sermons, his unexpected use of classical allusions, and his attention to the function of the imagination in poetic creation.

The following are the first six stanzas taken from this allegorical poem. Together they mean to warn readers of the snares of evil. The poet was a Puritan minister whose sermons and poems centred on virtuous and righteous living. Puritans were known for their religious devotion and ascetic observation of their work ethics. They feared Satan lingering around every corner of the world, ready to seduce and ruin them. 
In this part of the poem, Taylor uses the image of a spider catching a fly to represent Satan and his schemes to entrap men in sin. The spider could represent the devil, the wasp a sinner redeemed, and the fly an innocent believer who falls. 
Note the irregular metres and the conceits of the poem.

爱德华·泰勒（约1642-1729年）可能出生在英国的斯考奇利，美洲殖民时期的诗人、牧师和医生。他于1668年移居到马萨诸塞州波士顿，并于同年被哈佛大学录取。泰勒在《日记》中以鲜明的细节记录了他横渡大西洋的航行经历——猛烈的风暴、不同种类的鱼类和海鸟，以及最重要的是，他对萤火虫的着迷。诗人对自然的着迷延续到后来的岁月，正如他创作的诗歌《蜘蛛捕获苍蝇有感》和《冷得发抖的黄蜂》等作品所证明的那样。

在1671年从哈佛毕业后，泰勒接受了马萨诸塞州偏远小镇韦斯特菲尔德的宗教职位，他在那里写下了自己对牧师使命的怀疑和思考，记录在自己的私人诗歌系列中。作为一名牧师和医生长达五十八年的生涯中，他承担了满足会众的医疗和精神需求的责任，同时撰写了他最大的诗歌集《内省录》。这些超过两百首的宗教诗歌根据他的要求一直保存在手稿中，直到1937年才出版，当时它们被认为对早期美国文学史的重要性以及它们独特的诗歌价值同时得到了认可。泰勒的所有作品在1960年出版了完整版本。

泰勒是北美殖民时期的重要诗人之一，他的诗作体现了宗教精神和诗歌艺术的高度结合，主要诗作有《内省录》(Preparatory Meditations)，《上帝对其选民有影响的决定》(Gods Determinations Touching His Elect)，《诗体基督教史》(Metrical History of Christianity)。

在英国诗歌正逐渐进入新古典主义时期时，泰勒以约翰·邓恩的形而上体诗风格撰写诗歌，其特点是复杂的句法、惊人的比喻和直接亲密的表述。此外，泰勒的诗歌风格还表现出他沉思的技巧，将个人诗意思想与公开讲道相结合，出人意料地使用古典典故，关注想象力在诗歌创作中的作用。

这首寓言诗的前六节旨在警告读者邪恶的陷阱。诗人作为一位清教牧师，其讲道和诗歌都围绕着贞洁和正义的生活。清教徒以其宗教虔诚和禁欲主义的工作伦理而闻名。他们担心撒旦随时随地在世界的每个角落徘徊，准备引诱和毁灭他们。在诗的这一部分，泰勒使用蜘蛛捕捉苍蝇的形象来代表撒旦和他的计划，企图使人陷入罪恶。蜘蛛可能代表魔鬼，黄蜂代表一个得到救赎的罪人，而苍蝇则代表一个无辜的信徒堕落。请注意诗中不规则的韵律和奇思妙想。

【Selected Text】
Upon a Spider Catching a Fly 
(An Excerpt)
Thou sorrow, venom Elfe1:
Is this thy play,
To spin a web out of thyselfe
To Catch a Fly?
For Why?

I saw a pettish wasp
Fall foule therein:
Whom yet thy Whorle2 pins did not clasp
Lest he should fling
His sting.

But as affraid, remote
Didst stand hereat3,
And with thy little fingers stroke
And gently tap
His back.

Thus gently him didst treate
Lest he should pet4,
And in a froppish5, aspish6 heate
Should greatly fret7
Thy net.

Whereas the silly Fly,
Caught by its leg
Thou by the throate tookst hastily
And'hinde the head
Bite Dead.

This goes to pot8, that not
Nature doth call.
Strive not above what strength hath got,
Lest in the brawle
Thou fall.

To Catch a Fly?
这是你的游戏？
For Why?
何急？

Whereas the silly Fly,
而看那呆傻的苍蝇，
Caught by its leg
脚缠绊在网缧；
Thou by the throate tookst hastily
你扑上去扼住它的脖颈
And 'hinde the head
对准头一嘴
Bite Dead.
咬碎。
