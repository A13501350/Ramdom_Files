Anne Bradstreet **安妮·布莱德斯特里特** (1612-1672)，清教徒诗人，1630年从英国来到新大陆马萨诸塞湾殖民地，以**《第十个缪斯在美国出现》**闻名。

安妮1612年出生于英格兰北安普顿，父亲是林肯伯爵的管家。她成长在有文化的环境，受过良好教育。她学习了历史，多国语言和文学。1628年十六岁时，她嫁给了西蒙·布拉德斯特里特。安妮的父亲和丈夫后来都担任了马萨诸塞湾殖民地的总督。

1630年6月14日，安妮和西蒙，以及安妮的父母，作为温斯洛普清教徒移民舰队的一员，在阿贝拉号上移民到美国。作为清教徒向新英格兰(1620-1640年)迁徙的一部分，她和西蒙、父母以及其他航海者在现在的拓荒村(马萨诸塞州的**塞勒姆**)首次感受到了美国的土地。大多数人立即沿着海岸向南迁移到马萨诸塞州的**查尔斯顿**，在那里停留了一段时间，然后沿着查尔斯河向南迁移，在马萨诸塞州的**波士顿**发现了“山上的城市”。布拉德斯特里特一家很快又搬到了现在的马萨诸塞州的剑桥。

1650年，约翰·伍德布里奇牧师在伦敦出版的《来自那些地方的一位贵妇人》(_A Gentlewoman from Those Parts_)创作的第十首**《第十位缪斯在美洲出现》**(**_**The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America**_**)在美国迅速崛起，使**安妮成为英国和新世界出版的第一位女性诗人**。

美洲第一版的《第十位缪斯》经修订及扩增后出版，书名改为《一些风格各异、充满智慧的诗歌》(Several Poems Compiled with Great Variety of Wit and Learning)。其中大部分诗都是冗长的模仿性作品，只有最后两首《凡人的虚荣》(Of the vanity of all worldly creatures)和《大卫对扫罗和约拿单的哀悼》(David's Lamentation for Sauland Jonathan)独具风格，意境纯真。

她的一些诗歌是为她的家庭而写，表现了她全心接受清教徒教义后在精神上的成长过程。这些诗，如《灵与肉》(The Flesh and the Spirit)，因为没有说教而受人喜爱。她也写过一些动人的和更富有个人色彩的诗，其中《献给我亲爱的丈夫》(To My Dear and Loving Husband)、《人世正凋萎，万物有终极》(All things within this fading worldhath end)描写她在生孩子之前的思想；《心痛手颤写诗句》(With troubled heart and trembling hand I write)写一个孙儿之死。

  

  

Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672) is ranked as **the first American woman poet and the first American port of either sex**. 

Anne was born in England. Her parents valued education and let their children grow up with books. At 16, she was married to Simon Bradstreet, a Cambridge graduate. In 1630, Anne immigrated to the New World with her husband and parents. In the following years, she became the mother of eight children and her life was organized mainly around housework and caring for her children. Therefore, much of her poetic composition was intimately connected with her status as a wife and mother. 

Her first collection of poems appeared in London in 1650, titled The Tenth Muse **_Lately Sprung up_** **《第十位缪斯在美洲出现》**in America. **Most of her later poems were highly personal and domestic**. For example, her poems to her husband attest to their deep love and attachment. She depicts Simon as her "mine of gold" or her "Sun", whose absence is her "winter". She also writes of her illnesses, her children, and, as time goes on, of the deaths of her grandchildren, several of whom proved less hardy than their parents. 

Anne Bradstreet was **both a meditative and a lyric poet**. **Religious and domestic boundaries circumscribed the scope of her work**. Yet as an artist, she was unique in her time and place and progressed far beyond the level reached by the numerous religious and domestic female writers who flourished two centuries later. 

In culturally limited Massachusetts in the middle decades of the seventeenth century, she could apply the techniques she had learned from English and French Renaissance poets to the raw material of her own life.

  

Sometime in autumn, the poet gazes upon the rich, colourful beauty of the fall trees, looking at a "stately" oak tree and reflecting on its great age. She hears grasshoppers and crickets sing, feels a nightingale perch on her head and sing a sweet song that fills her with wonder and delight. Then, like [**Keats**](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247490065&idx=1&sn=257b540cc2e664c222756083485c9a7a&chksm=c2a327bef5d4aea8270b30e97c1d1f21d1bca146d4317c849a255cea064be2260117defd66ae&scene=21#wechat_redirect), she speaks to the "merry bird", admiring the bird's song throughout the summer. 

**This contemplation leads the poet, quite in the vein of Puritans, to ponder the meaning of human existence**. Man is a creature, even at his best, prone to frailty, vanity, ignorance and weakness. He is sickly and feels sorrow, pain, and loss. His mind is a storm, and his body can break. He is continually troubled by his friends, foes, and family. **However, man, this "lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow", thinks not of eternal life but focuses on his struggles on Earth**. 

"Contemplations"**《沉思》** is Anne Bradstreet's greatest poetic achievement. As in many of her most significant works, this poem expresses "**the complexity of Bradstreet's struggle between love of the world and desire for eternal life**". 

Bradstreet's frequent use of assonance and alliteration in this poem creates a unified poetic voice.

  

【Selected Text】

**Contemplations** 

(Excerpts)

Sometime now past in the Autumnal Tide,

When Phoebus1 wanted but one hour to bed,

The trees al richly clad2, yet void of pride,

Were gilded o're3 by his rich golden head.

Their leaves and fruits seem'd painted but was true

Of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hue,

Rapt were my senses at this delectable4view.

  

Then on a stately Oak I cast mine Eye,

Whose ruffling top the Clouds seem'd to aspire;

How long since thou wast in thine Infancy?

Thy strength and stature, more thy years admire,

Hath hundred winters past since thou wast born?

Or thousand since thou brakest5 thy shell of horn,

If so, all these as nought, Eternity doth scorn.

  

I heard the merry grasshopper then sing,

The black clad Cricket bear a second part.

They kept one tune and played on the same string,

Seeming to glory in their little Art.

Shall creatures abject6 thus their voices raise?

And in their kind resound their maker's praise:

Whilst I, as mute, can warble forth no higher layes7.

  

While musing thus with contemplation fed,

And thousand fancies buzzing in my brain,

The sweet-tongu'd Philomel8 percht ore9my head,

And chanted forth a most melodious strain

Which rapt me so with wonder and delight, 

I judg'd my hearing better than my sight,

And wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight.

  

O merry Bird (said I) that fears no snares,

That neither toyles10 nor hoards up in thy barn,

Feels no sad thoughts, nor cruciating11cares

To gain more good, or shun what might thee harm

Thy clothes ne're wear, thy meat is every where,

Thy bed a bough, thy drink the water clear,

Reminds not what is past, nor whats to come dost fear.

  

The dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent,

Sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew,

So each one tunes his pretty instrument,

And warbling out the old, begin anew,

And thus they pass their youth in summer season,

Then follow thee into a better Region,

Where winter's never felt by that sweet airy legion.

  

Man at the best a creature frail and vain,

In knowledge ignorant, in strength but weak,

Subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain,  

Each storm his state, his mind, his body break,

From some of these he never finds cessation.

But day or night, within, without, vexation,

Troubles from foes, from friends, from dearest, near'st Relation.

  

And yet this sinfull creature, frail and vain,

This lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow,

This weather-beaten vessel wrackt12 with pain,

Joys not in hope of an eternal morrow;

Nor all his losses, crosses and vexation,

In weight, in frequency and long duration

Can make him deeply groan for that divine Translation13.

  

O Time the fatal wrack of mortal things, 

That draws oblivions curtains over kings,

Their sumptuous monuments, men know them not,

Their names without a Record are forgot,

Their parts, their ports, their pomp's all laid in th'dust.

Nor wit, nor gold, nor buildings scape times rust;

But he whose name is grav'd in the white stone14

Shall last and shine when all of these are gone.

**Puritan** 清教徒，是指要求[清除英国国教中天主教残余的](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247512699&idx=1&sn=bc541ab5658c471fa9a20ec9efe498ca&chksm=c2a08fd4f5d706c225baf5d6e73c9f83f4800d6d24095964b45381664a7210dc77308af471c7&scene=21#wechat_redirect)改革派。其字词于16世纪60年代开始使用，源于拉丁文的Purus，意为清洁。清教徒的先驱者产生于[玛丽一世](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247512682&idx=1&sn=bba38d3c4cc045fb489a809a6debf92b&chksm=c2a08fc5f5d706d393bfd2724ab869a568cf90c1ffee80eb7b61c126aa7f43622067acc883e4&scene=21#wechat_redirect)统治后期，流亡于欧洲大陆的英国新教团体中。随后，**部分移居至美洲**。

清教徒信奉加尔文主义(Calvinism)，认为《圣经》才是唯一最高权威，任何教会或个人都不能成为传统权威的解释者和维护者。

清教徒不仅仅是一种派别，更加是一种态度，一种倾向，一种价值观，它是对信徒群体信仰的一种统称。清教徒是最为虔敬、生活最为圣洁的新教徒，他们认为“人人皆祭司，人人有召唤”。认为每个个体可以直接与上帝交流，反对神甫集团的专横、腐败和繁文缛节、形式主义。他们主张简单、实在、上帝面前人人平等的信徒生活。

清教徒时代，人类史上才真正出现了职业这个概念。当时的职业一词是calling。Calling含有“**召唤、神召、呼唤、呼叫**”的意思，意即**上帝在天上呼唤你、命令你该有何种行为**。这个词义中无疑含有宗教意义：职业即是天职，是上帝安排的任务，这是职业的最初定义。

在清教徒的理解中，职业就是一件**被冥冥之中的神所召唤、所使唤、所命令、所安排的任务**，而完成这个任务，既是每个个体天赋的职责和义务，也是感谢神的恩召的举动。如上帝曾召唤亚伯拉罕作虔诚且富有的君王，他凭着信心最后成就了召唤，成为富甲万国、繁衍众多的君王。上帝也召唤清教徒开拓北美的疆土，把在美国国度上的创业视为天职。
