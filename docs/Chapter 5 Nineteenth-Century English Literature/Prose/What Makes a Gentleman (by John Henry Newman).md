## About John Henry Newman.

John Henry Newman (1801-1890) grew up in a close-knit family. At age fifteen, shortly before he entered Oxford, Newman underwent a period of extreme mental crisis, which he later described as his conversion. He became deeply religious thereafter, believing that God had destined him for a high spiritual task. 

Newman was England's leading intellectual and ecclesiastical figure in the mid-nineteenth century. His reflections in Tracts for the Times (1833-1841) helped launch the influential Oxford Movement, which brought religious issues to the forefront of the Victorian consciousness. The movement is also known as the Catholic Revival. It emphasized the church's identity as the divine society and the sacramental character of the church's corporate life. Newman became a leading figure in the Oxford Movement, writing eloquently about spiritual life and university education. Among his numerous works, The Idea of a University Defined and Illustrated (1873) is considered monumental to the establishment of modern universities in Western countries. The book also provides some fundamental references to the educationalists of developing countries. This illuminating book is composed of two parts: "University Teaching" and "University Subjects". The first part is generally considered the core of the book, consisting of nine lectures delivered in Dublin in 1852 during the process of establishing the Catholic University of Ireland. Newman would return to Dublin in 1854 as rector for the university, where he served for nearly four years. During this time, he published several essays and delivered lectures to various departments of the university, and ten of these occasional pieces became the material for the second part of the book.

Newman's major contributions to English literature are his volumes of prose, especially his spiritual autobiography, his analysis of the nature of belief, and his writings on education. In an eloquent yet accessible style, he explored his subjects with great erudition and sincerity. His works continue to be read as examples of the essay at its best.

## About This Selection

The following is John Henry Newman's famous definition of a "gentleman", excerpted from "Discourse VIII" of his well-known work The Idea of a University Defined and Illustrated (1873).

In the book, Newman provides a compelling definition and defence of a liberal arts education, arguing that the primary purpose of a university is to develop the mind, not deliver information.

In "Discourse VIII", having distinguished between a morality purely based on reason and that founded on religious belief, Newman gives his definition of a gentleman, indicating that a well-educated character can both harness reason-based ethics and uphold an ultimate faith in the truth.

This is a superb example of character writing. Note how Newman uses parallel structures in this extended definition, in particular, his use of paired constructions and tricolons.

**What Makes a Gentleman**

Hence it is that it is almost a definition of a gentleman to say he is one who never inflicts pain. This description is both refined and, as far as it goes, accurate. He is mainly occupied in merely removing the obstacles which hinder the free and unembarrassed action of those about him; and he concurs with their movements rather than takes the initiative himself. His benefits may be considered as parallel to what are called comforts or conveniences in arrangements of a personal nature: like an easy chair or a good fire, which do their part in dispelling cold and fatigue, though nature provides both means of rest and animal heat without them. 

The true gentleman in like manner carefully avoids whatever may cause a jar or a jolt in the minds of those with whom he is cast; —all clashing of opinion, or collision of feeling, all restraint, or suspicion, or gloom, or resentment; his great concern being to make every one at their ease and at home. He has his eyes on all his company; he is tender towards the bashful, gentle towards the distant, and merciful towards the absurd; he can recollect to whom he is speaking; he guards against unseasonable allusions, or topics which may irritate; he is seldom prominent in conversation, and never wearisome. He makes light of favours while he does them, and seems to be receiving when he is conferring. He never speaks of himself except when compelled, never defends himself by a mere retort, he has no ears for slander or gossip, is scrupulous in imputing motives to those who interfere with him, and interprets every thing for the best. 

He is never mean or little in his disputes, never takes unfair advantage, never mistakes personalities or sharp sayings for arguments, or insinuates evil which he dare not say out. From a long-sighted prudence, he observes the maxim of the ancient sage, that we should ever conduct ourselves towards our enemy as if he were one day to be our friend. He has too much good sense to be affronted at insults, he is too well employed to remember injuries, and too indolent to bear malice. He is patient, forbearing, and resigned, on philosophical principles; he submits to pain, because it is inevitable, to bereavement, because it is irreparable, and to death, because it is his destiny. If he engages in controversy of any kind, his disciplined intellect preserves him from the blundering discourtesy of better, perhaps, but less educated minds; who, like blunt weapons, tear and hack instead of cutting clean, who mistake the point in argument, waste their strength on trifles, misconceive their adversary, and leave the question more involved than they find it. 

He may be right or wrong in his opinion, but he is too clear-headed to be unjust; he is as simple as he is forcible, and as brief as he is decisive. Nowhere shall we find greater candour, consideration, indulgence: he throws himself into the minds of his opponents, he accounts for their mistakes. He knows the weakness of human reason as well as its strength, its province and its limits.


## 关于约翰·亨利·纽曼

约翰·亨利·纽曼(1801-1890)在一个关系密切的家庭中长大。15岁时，在他进入牛津大学前不久，纽曼经历了一段极端的精神危机时期，他后来将其描述为他的皈依。从那以后，他成为了虔诚的信徒，相信上帝注定要他承担崇高的精神使命。

纽曼是十九世纪中叶英国知识分子和教会的领军人物。他在《时代小册子》(1833-1841)中的反思帮助发起了有影响力的牛津运动，该运动将宗教问题带到了维多利亚意识的最前沿。这场运动也被称为天主教复兴运动。它强调教会作为神圣社会的身份和教会集体生活的圣礼特征。纽曼成为牛津运动的领军人物，在精神生活和大学教育方面著述颇丰。在他的众多作品中，《大学的定义与阐释》(1873)被认为是西方近代大学建立的里程碑。本书还为发展中国家的教育工作者提供了一些基本的参考。这本启发性的书由“大学教学”和“大学学科”两部分组成。第一部分通常被认为是全书的核心，包括1852年在都柏林建立爱尔兰天主教大学期间的九次演讲。纽曼将于1854年回到都柏林担任大学校长，在那里他服务了近四年。在此期间，他发表了几篇论文，并在大学的各个部门发表了演讲，其中十篇偶然的文章成为了本书第二部分的素材。

纽曼对英国文学的主要贡献是他的大量散文，特别是他的精神自传，他对信仰本质的分析，以及他关于教育的著作。在一种雄辩而又平易近人的风格中，他以渊博的学识和真诚探索了他的主题。他的作品继续被视为最佳散文的范例。

## 关于本选

以下是约翰·亨利·纽曼对“绅士”的著名定义，摘自他的著名著作《大学的定义和阐释》(1873)的“论述VIII”。

在书中，纽曼为文科教育提供了一个令人信服的定义和辩护，认为大学的主要目的是发展思想，而不是传递信息。

在“论述VIII”中，纽曼区分了纯粹基于理性的道德和基于宗教信仰的道德，给出了他对绅士的定义，一个受过良好教育、能够运用理性伦理并同时坚守终极真理信仰的人物形象。

这是一个极好的人物描写的例子。请注意纽曼在这个扩展定义中是如何使用平行结构，特别是他对成对表达以及三段论式的修辞手法的使用。

##  绅士的定义

因此，我们几乎可以说，“绅士”这一称谓近乎一种定义，即他是一位永不施加痛苦于他人之人。这样的描述既显微妙且在一定程度上准确无误。绅士主要专注于仅仅扫除那些妨碍周围人自由、无拘束行动的障碍，并乐于顺应他人的步伐而非自己抢占先机。他的存在好处可类比于个人生活安排中的种种舒适设施，如一把舒适的座椅或是熊熊燃烧的好火，它们虽非不可或缺，却能在驱散寒冷与疲劳方面发挥积极的作用，尽管大自然本身已为我们提供了休憩和暖身之法。

真正的绅士同样小心翼翼地规避任何可能导致身边人心灵不适的因素——无论是意见上的冲撞还是情感上的对立，无论是束缚感、猜疑、沉闷抑或是怨恨；他最关切的是让每个人都能感到自在如家。他关注周遭每一个人的状态，对待羞涩者柔情款款，对疏离者温和有礼，对出乖露丑者慈悲为怀；他时刻注意对话对象，谨防不合时宜的话题或可能引发不满的言辞；他在交谈中往往并不突出自我，更不会令人生厌。他行善时轻描淡写，仿佛是在接受恩惠一般；除非迫不得已，他从不谈论自己，也不屑以单纯的反驳来为自己辩护；他不屑于流言蜚语，对他人的动机深究审慎，在被干涉时绝不轻易揣测恶意，总是尽量以最佳的眼光去解读一切事物。

此外，他从不因琐事而卑鄙狭隘，在争论中绝不高人一等，不利用不公平的优势，不会将人身攻击或尖刻言语当作辩论的依据，也不会含沙射影地暗示不敢明说的恶毒话语。出于深思熟虑的智慧，他遵循古圣贤的格言，即使面对敌人也要像对待未来的朋友那样行事。他有足够的理智去平息侮辱带来的冲动，过于忙碌而不记挂伤害，太懒惰以至于不愿怀恨在心。他充满耐心，不轻易动怒，宽宏大量，不计前嫌，遇事泰然处之。忍受痛苦，因为痛苦无可避免，承受失去亲人的悲痛，因为这是无法挽回的损失，面对死亡，因为他视之为命运使然。一旦参与任何形式的争论，他训练有素的智力让他免于犯下无知无礼的错误，这些错误可能是出自更有天赋但教育不足的人，他们如同钝器般撕扯破坏而非精准剖析问题，会在论点上犯错，将精力浪费在细枝末节上，误解对手的观点，结果反而将问题复杂化而非澄清。

或许他在观点上可能正确也可能错误，但他头脑清醒，不至于做出不公之事；他既有力量又简单明了，果断之余亦言简意赅。在他身上，我们找不到比这更大的坦诚、体谅和宽容：他会设身处地理解对手的想法，为对手的错误寻找原因。他深知人类理性的弱点及其局限，同时也清楚其力量所在及其适用范围。
