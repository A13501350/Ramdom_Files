## About William Wordsworth

William Wordsworth (1770-1850) had mixed joys and terrors of his boyhood. His parents died when he grew into his teens. He attended St John's College, Cambridge, but disliked the academic course. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of France, the Alps, and Italy, and returned to France late in 1791 to spend a year there; during this period, he was fired by a passionate belief in the French Revolution and republican ideals. But the institution of the Terror soon disillusioned him. He then settled down in the Lake District and became a poet. 

In 1798, jointly with Samuel Coleridge, Wordsworth published Lyrical Ballads, a collection of poetry which includes many of his famous poems, "The Idiot Boy", "Tintern Abbey", and "We Are Seven", to mention but a few. In the preface, he asserts that poetry must concern itself with “the primary laws of our nature" and the "low and rustic life"; poetry is a form of art that touches the depths of human emotion. For these features, he famously puts that "**poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings recollected in tranquillity**”. To write good poetry, poets must use “simple and unelaborated” and thus “a far more philosophical language” to capture the reader’s intuitive feelings and imagination. For these declarations, Lyrical Ballads marks the beginning of the Romantic movement in literature, and the preface describes and demonstrates many of the characteristics of Romantic poetry. Wordsworth's autobiographical poem, The Prelude, appeared after his death. The book chronicles his life from early childhood onwards. Wordsworth wrote essays, and the most notable one is A Description of the Scenery ofthe Lakes in the North of England, written in 1810, of which the following selection is an illuminating part. 

To put it in general terms, William Wordsworth was one of the leading English Romantic poets. Along with William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats, he created a major revolution in ideology and poetic style at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth. These romantic poets rebelled against the neoclassical tradition exemplified in the works of Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson (see pages 136 and 127 of this book).

威廉姆华兹华斯(1770-1850)的少年时代喜忧参半。他的父母在他十几岁的时候就去世了。他就读于剑桥大学圣约翰学院，但不喜欢那里的学术课程。1790年，他徒步游览了法国、阿尔卑斯山和意大利，并于1791年底回到法国，在那里呆了一年;在此期间，他被对法国大革命和共和理想的狂热信仰所激发。但恐怖制度很快使他的幻想破灭。后来，他在湖区定居下来，成为一名诗人。

1798年，华兹华斯与塞缪尔柯勒律治共同出版了《抒情歌谣》，这是一本诗集，其中包括他的许多著名诗歌，如《白痴男孩》、《丁登修道院》和《我们七个人》等等。在序言中，他断言，诗歌必须关注“我们天性的基本法则”和“低微质朴的生活”;诗歌是一种触及人类情感深处的艺术形式。对于这些特点，他有一句名言:“诗歌是在宁静中回忆起来的强烈情感的自发溢出”。要写出好诗，诗人必须使用“简单而不加雕琢”，从而“用一种远比哲学更富哲理的语言”来捕捉读者的直觉感受和想象。对于这些宣言来说，《抒情歌谣》标志着文学中浪漫主义运动的开始，序言描述和展示了浪漫主义诗歌的许多特征。华兹华斯的自传体诗《序曲》是在他死后发表的。这本书记录了他从童年早期开始的生活。华兹华斯写散文，其中最著名的一篇是1810年写的《英格兰北部湖泊风光描述》，下面的选段是其中一个有启发性的部分。

概括地说，威廉姆华兹华斯是英国最重要的浪漫主义诗人之一。他与威廉姆·布莱克、塞缪尔·泰勒·柯勒律治、拜伦勋爵、珀西·比希·雪莱和约翰·济慈一起，在18世纪末和19世纪初在意识形态和诗歌风格方面掀起了一场重大革命。这些浪漫主义诗人对新古典主义传统的反抗体现在亚历山大·波普和塞缪尔·约翰逊的作品中(见本书第136页和127页)。

## About This Selection

This is one of the most typical passages of Wordsworth's description of the landscape in the Lake District. It is selected from A Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England, commonly known as Wordsworth's Guide to the Lakes. In this work, Wordsworth provides a historical picture of society in the region, loving depictions of the landscape, and practical travel information for inhabitants and tourists. Wordsworth also encourages his reader to protect the Lakeland ecology, emphasizing that "much of the charm that was, depended upon what was not." 

In this sense, Wordsworth is rightly remembered not only as a poet who loves nature and has sympathy for the common man but also as a pioneer of environmentalist writing. Reading Wordsworth's description of the mountain tarns in this passage, readers will be enthralled by how the poet lets his spontaneous feelings overflow and sift into a beautifully tranquil rural landscape.

## Selected Text

**Mountain Tarns in the Lake District**

The mountain Tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller' who has time to spare. They are difficult of access and naked?; yet some of them are, in their permanent forms, very grand; and there are accidents of things' which would make the meanest of them interesting. At all events, one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer, not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect', but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects, otherwise disconnected of unsubordinated, may be referred'. Some few have a varied outline, with bold heath-clad promontories; and, as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice, the water, where the sun is not shining upon it, appears black and sullen; and round the margin huge stones and masses of rock are scattered; some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came there, and others obviously fallen from on high-the contribution of ages! A not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity, and these images of decay; while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied, and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth, and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes'. Nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools: though desolate and forbidding®, it seems a distinct place to repair to'; yet where the visitants must be rare, and there can be no disturbance. Water-fowl flock hither; and the lonely Angler may oftentimes here be seen: but the imagination, not content with this scanty allowance of society", is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot, whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water, or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices.

对于那些有充足闲暇时光且充满好奇心的旅者而言，山中的湖（tarns）无疑是值得一探究竟的。它们位置偏远且地形原始，然而在它们恒久不变的形态中，有的确实极其壮观；并且总有某些偶然发生的自然现象令哪怕是最不起眼的湖也变得饶有趣味。无论如何，对于漫游在山间的旅人来说，其中一个这样的湖泊不仅因其增添了风景的多样性而值得一看，更因为它会在旅人心中构成一个焦点或显眼的地标，使得原本看似无关或层次不明的景物能够有所归属。少数几座湖的轮廓蜿蜒多样，有着大胆裸露的石楠覆盖的岬角；由于大多数都坐落在陡峭悬崖脚下，当阳光未照耀其上时，水面会呈现出阴郁沉寂的黑色；而在湖边边缘，巨大的石块和岩石堆积四处可见，有些让人猜不透它们是如何到达此处的，另一些明显是从高处跌落下来的，是经年累月的自然积淀。这样的谜团以及衰败的景象不由得唤起一种虽不令人痛苦却同样深刻的哀伤情绪；与此同时，眼前这一片缺乏林木和其他常见乡村意象陪伴的纯净水面，无法滋养周边稀疏的植被，反而激发出一种强烈排斥力的感觉，从而加深了人们面对这类场景时自然而然产生的忧郁心情。此外，在这样一处荒凉而又拒人千里的山中湖畔，孤独感往往会被更为深刻和庄重地感受到；尽管它似乎是一个独立的、可作为目的地的地方，然而访客稀少，无人打扰。水鸟成群结队来到这里栖息；偶尔也能见到孤独垂钓者在此的身影；然而想象力并未满足于这份稀薄的人迹，而是倾向于赋予在这片静谧之地发生的每一点变化以自主的力量，无论是飘过水面的微风，还是在四周险峻悬崖映衬下，傍晚时分洒落在湖面上的绚丽霞光。
