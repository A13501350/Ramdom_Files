Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) was a temperamental, imaginative child born into a vicar's family. He studied at Jesus College, Cambridge (1792-1794) without a degree. But his dreamy disposition would soon help him to write poetry. He began to publish his poetry, In 1797, he met Wordsworth,, and the friendship between them shaped their lives for the next fourteen years and proved one of the most creative, partnerships in English Romanticism. The friendship was, based on a mutual love of poetry, critical discussion, and hill-walking; and a judicious response to the political and social problems of the age. They were visited by'Lamb (see page 179 of this book), Hazlitt (see page 183 of this book) and others. Coleridge wrote a moving series of blank verse to his friends. He also composed his celebrated opium-vision "Kubla Khan". At Wordsworth's suggestion, Coleridge wrote his famous, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner", which recounts a nightmare sea-voyage with powerful metaphysical overtones. Working closely with Wordsworth, he helped publish Zyrical Ballads (1798), which achieved a revolution in poetic taste and literary tradition. In 1800 he moved to the Lake District with Wordsworth. In 1808, though ill, Coleridge began his series of Lectures on Poetry and Drama, which he continued sporadically over the next decade. He also wrote Shakespearean Criticism, introducing new concepts of "organic” form and dramatic psychology. His Biographia Literaria was published in 1817, a major work of poetic criticism, philosophy, and humorous autobiography. In this important work, Coleridge discusses the influences that shaped his development as an artist; he takes up various topics regardingd poetic form, including diction, advocates the importance of individuality in art and demonstrates his own individual sepsibility. Coleridge was more than a romantic poet. He was a famous critic and philosopher of Romanticism.

## About This Selection

From June 1, 1809, to March 14, 1810, Coleridge published at irregular intervals a "weekly essay" known as The Friend, discussing many of his views on poetic imagination on ad philosophical basis. The following excerpt is taken from one of these essays. Coleridge kept an intimate friendship with Wordsworth. Coleridge once proclaimed he knew Wordsworth better than he knew himself. He believed Wordsworth was brilliant. But as time went by, his poetic power and passion peaked and declined. Wanting to distance himself from Wordsworth's philosophy on poetry, he wrote his Biographia Literaria in 1817, But before that, he already embarked on the same boat as Wordsworth to explore the issues of imagination and creativity in poetry. This excerpt discusses the prime character and merit of genius that leads to our understanding of why romantic poets would love to say that "The Child is the father of the Man".


## 译文:《天才与新奇》(塞缪尔·泰勒·柯勒律治著)

关于塞缪尔·泰勒·柯勒律治

塞缪尔·泰勒·柯勒律治(Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 1772-1834)出生在一个牧师家庭，是个喜怒无常、富于想象力的孩子。他曾就读于剑桥耶稣学院(1792-1794)，没有学位。但他爱做梦的性格很快帮助他写诗。1797年，他遇到了华兹华斯，他们之间的友谊在接下来的14年里塑造了他们的生活，并被证明是英国浪漫主义中最具创造性的伙伴关系之一。这种友谊建立在对诗歌的共同热爱、批判性的讨论和山间散步的基础上;以及对那个时代的政治和社会问题的明智回应。他们被兰姆(见本书第179页)、黑兹利特(见本书第183页)等人拜访过。柯勒律治给他的朋友们写了一系列动人的无韵诗。他还创作了著名的鸦片幻想曲《忽必烈汗》。在华兹华斯的建议下，柯勒律治写下了他的名作《古水手咏》，讲述了一场噩梦般的海上航行，带有强烈的玄学色彩。他与华兹华斯密切合作，帮助出版了《抒情歌谣》(1798)，在诗歌品味和文学传统上实现了一场革命。1800年，他和华兹华斯一起搬到了湖区。1808年，尽管病了，柯勒律治还是开始了他的诗歌和戏剧系列讲座，在接下来的十年里，他断断续续地继续着。他还写了《莎士比亚批评》，引入了“有机”形式和戏剧心理学的新概念。他的《文学传记》出版于1817年，是一部关于诗歌批评、哲学和幽默自传的重要著作。在这部重要的作品中，柯勒律治讨论了影响他作为艺术家发展的因素;他接受了关于诗歌形式的各种话题，包括措辞，主张个性在艺术中的重要性，并展示了他自己的个人敏感性。柯勒律治不仅仅是一位浪漫主义诗人。他是一位著名的浪漫主义批评家和哲学家。

## 关于本选集

从1809年6月1日到1810年3月14日，柯勒律治不定期地发表一篇名为《朋友》的“周报”，讨论了他在哲学基础上对诗歌想象的许多看法。以下节选自其中一篇随笔。柯勒律治与华兹华斯保持着亲密的友谊。柯勒律治曾宣称他比自己还了解华兹华斯。他认为华兹华斯才华横溢。但随着时间的流逝，他的诗歌力量和激情达到顶峰，然后又下降。为了与华兹华斯的诗歌哲学划清界限，他在1817年写了《文学传记》，但在此之前，他已经和华兹华斯一样，开始探索诗歌中的想象力和创造力问题。这段节选讨论了天才的主要特征和优点，从而使我们理解为什么浪漫主义诗人喜欢说“孩子是男人的父亲”。

## Selected Text

**Genius and Novelty**

But to find no contradiction in the union of old and new, to contemplate the Ancient of Days with feelings as fresh as if they then sprang forth at his own fiat', this characterises the minds that feel the riddle of the world?, and may help to unravel' it! To carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood, to combine the child's sense of wonder and novelty" with the appearances which every day for perhaps forty years has rendered familiar,

With sun and moon and stars throughout the year, And man and woman—

this is the character and privilege of genius, and one of the marks which distinguish genius from talents. And so to represent familiar objects as to awaken the minds of others to a like freshness of sensation concerning them (that constant accompaniment of mental, no less than of bodily convalescences) this is the prime merit of genius, and its most unequivocal mode of manifestation. Who has not, a thousand times, seen it snow upon water? Who has not seen it with a new feeling, since he has read Burns's comparison of sensual pleasure

To snow that falls upon a river, A moment white-then melts forever!

In philosophy, equally as in poetry, genius produces the strongest impressions of novelty, while it rescues the stalest and most admitted truths' from the impotence caused by the very circumstances of their universal admission. Extremes meet a proverb, by the by®, to collect and explain all the instances and exemplifications of which, would constitute and exhaust' all philosophy. Truths, of all others the most awful and mysterious, yet being at the same time of universal interest, are too often considered as so true that they lose all the powers of truth, and lie bed-ridden in the dormitory of the soul, side by side with the most despised and exploded errors.

(from The Friend)

2. riddle of the world: secret of the world 
3. unravel: solve, find the solution to (a problem), 
4. novelty: newness 
5. convalescence: recovery (from an illness) 
6. Burns: Robert Burns, the poet (see page 149 of this book) 
7. most admitted truths: truths universally acknowledged as truths 
8. by the by: soon; after a brief moment 
9. exhaust: explain completely


但是，能够在古老与新奇的统一中找寻到无悖论的存在，怀着如同它们初次诞生时的新鲜感去思考宇宙的初始，这正是那些能够感受世界之谜并可能解开谜团的心灵的特征。将童年的惊奇与新颖感延续到成年后的力量之中，将儿童对于奇妙与新鲜的认知与那些或许已经持续了四十年、每天都在眼前出现的熟悉景象
相结合

（如太阳、月亮、星星一年四季的轮回，以及人类男女的日常生活）

这就是天才的品质与特权，也是区分天才与一般才能的一个标志。因此，天才的一个首要贡献和最明确的表现方式就是能够以一种新颖的方式呈现寻常的事物，从而唤起他人对此类事物的新鲜感知（正如身心康复过程中的持久伴随状态），这种再现是天才的首要优点。例如，谁未曾无数次看到雪花落在水面上？但自从读过罗伯特·彭斯将感官快乐比拟为落在河流上的雪花，“一时洁白，随即消融”的诗句之后，又有谁能不对这一常见的景象萌生出全新的感触呢？

在哲学和诗歌领域，天才均能创造出最强烈的新颖印象，同时也能将那些因过度普遍接受而丧失影响力的公认真理重新恢复其影响力。最极端的情况诸如谚语，倘若收集并解释所有相关的实例和例证，实际上就已经构成了并穷尽了所有的哲学内涵。即便是最崇高且神秘的真理，因为过于显然而被认为失去了所有真理的力量，就像躺在灵魂寝室中沉睡的病人，与那些早已被唾弃和摒弃的错误并列在一起，天才则有能力使之重新焕发生命力。
