## About Charles Lamb

Charles Lamb (1775-1834) was born in London into a lawyer's family and was educated at Christ's Hospital, where he first met Samuel Coleridge. They have remained intimate friends ever since. In 1792, he obtained a job in the East India House, where he worked until his retirement in 1825. In 1795, he was mentally deranged, and the threat of madness became a shadow on his life. In 1796, his sister Mary, in a fit of insanity, killed their mother. Aside from working and writing, Lamb shouldered the responsibility of taking care of his sister for life. 

Lamb began his literary career writing poetry and continued to write verse his entire life. He tried his hand at other genres, however, and is remembered primarily for his familiar essays. Lamb wrote a number of plays with moderate success. With his sister, he wrote Tales from Shakespeare (1807), a book with universal appeal to the young. The Adventures of Ulysses (1808) followed similarly. His Specimens of English Dramatic Poets who Lived about the Time of Shakespeare (1808) almost established him as a critic. His other critical essays were "On the Tragedies of Shakespeare" and "On the Genius and Character of Hogarth". From 1820 to 1823, Lamb contributed articles to the London Magazine, in which appeared the first series of essays known as Essays of Elia. The second series was published in 1833. Of his poems, the best known are "The Old Familiar Faces", the lyrical ballad "Hester" (1803), and an elegy "On an Infant Dying as Soon as Born" (1827), probably his finest poem. Album Verses (1830) includes many other lyrics and sonnets. 

Lamb was good at brief but accurate characterization. His generalized but perceptive comments made his essays original and illuminating. Today's literary critics value his essays because they embody and reflect the romantic spirit found in the great poetry of that time. These familiar essays have a biographical impulse, organic form, symbolic representation, syntactic flexibility, and occasional subject matter.

查尔斯·兰姆(1775-1834)出生在伦敦的一个律师家庭，在基督医院接受教育，在那里他第一次见到塞缪尔·柯勒律治。从那以后，他们一直是亲密的朋友。1792年，他在东印度大厦找到一份工作，一直工作到1825年退休。1795年，他精神错乱，疯狂的威胁成为他生活中的阴影。1796年，他的妹妹玛丽突发精神失常，杀死了他们的母亲。除了工作和写作，兰姆还肩负着照顾妹妹一生的责任。

兰姆的文学生涯是从写诗开始的，他一生都在写诗。然而，他也尝试过其他类型的作品，人们对他的记忆主要是他熟悉的散文。兰姆写了一些剧本，都取得了一定的成功。他和妹妹一起写了《莎士比亚故事集》(1807)，这是一本对年轻人具有普遍吸引力的书。《尤利西斯历险记》(1808)也紧随其后。他的《生活在莎士比亚时代的英国戏剧诗人样本》(1808)几乎奠定了他作为评论家的地位。他的其他评论文章有《论莎士比亚的悲剧》和《论贺加斯的天才与性格》。从1820年到1823年，兰姆为《伦敦杂志》撰稿，在该杂志上出现了第一批被称为《伊利亚随笔》的随笔。第二部出版于1833年。在他的诗中，最著名的是《熟悉的老面孔》、抒情歌谣《海丝特》(1803)和挽歌《关于一个刚出生就死去的婴儿》(1827)，这可能是他最好的诗。专辑诗句(1830)包括许多其他歌词和十四行诗。

兰姆擅长简短而准确的描述。他概括而敏锐的评论使他的文章具有原创性和启发性。今天的文学评论家重视他的散文，因为它们体现和反映了当时伟大诗歌中的浪漫精神。这些熟悉的文章具有传记性的冲动、有机的形式、象征性的表现、句法的灵活性和偶然的主题。

## About This Selection

Presented in the following is an eccentric view of Lamb: he says he cannot like Scotchmen, though he has tried all his life the otherwise. The passage is taken from the essay "Imperfect Sympathies" collected in Lamb's famous Essays of Elia. After reading the excerpt, one may applaud Lamb's honesty, his apologetic tone, his detailed description of the two contrasting ways of thinking, and above all, his sense of humour expressed piecemeal in his accurate use and effortless flow of words and phrases. Yet one may doubt that Lamb has been a bit biased in describing Scotsmen as absolutely dogmatic thinkers, hopelessly alien to the nuance of things, and totally blind to metaphor, irony and humour. But one thing could be agreed upon by everyone that Lamb's humour is, perhaps, not rich, but it is true and rare. And that is what Charles Lamb is valued for in the history of English literature.

下面是兰姆的一种古怪的观点:他说他不能喜欢苏格兰人，尽管他一生都在尝试不喜欢苏格兰人。这段话摘自兰姆著名的《以利亚随笔》中的文章《不完美的同情》。读完节选后，人们可能会为兰姆的诚实、他的道歉语气、他对两种截然不同的思维方式的详细描述，以及最重要的是，他的幽默感在他准确的使用和毫不费力的词汇和短语中表达出来。然而，有人可能会怀疑，兰姆把苏格兰人描述成绝对教条主义的思想家，对事物的细微差别绝望地陌生，对隐喻、讽刺和幽默完全视而不见，这有点偏颇。但有一件事是大家都同意的，那就是兰姆的幽默也许并不丰富，但却是真实而罕见的。这就是查尔斯·兰姆在英国文学史上的价值所在。

## Selected Text

**Imperfect Intellect and Its Perfect Opposite**

I have been trying all my life to like Scotchmen, and am obliged to' desist from the experiment in despair. They cannot like me,—and in truth, I never knew one of that nation who attempted to do it. There is something more plain and ingenuous in their mode of proceeding. 
We know one another at first sight. There is an order of imperfect intellects (under which mine must be content to rank), which in its constitution is essentially anti-Caledonian?. The owners of the sort of faculties I allude to have minds rather suggestive than comprehensive. They have no pretences to much clearness or precision in their ideas, or in their manner of expressing them.
Their intellectual wardrobe' (to confess fairly) has few whole pieces in it. They are content with fragments and scattered pieces of truth. Shes presents no full front to them—a feature or side-face at the most. Hints and glimpses, germs and crude essays at a system, is the utmost they pretend to. They beat up' a little game peradventure and leave it to knottier heads', more robust constitutions, to run it down. The light that lights them is not steady and polar, but mutable and shifting: waxing, and again waning. Their conversation is accordingly. They will throw out a random word in or out of season, and be content to let it pass for what it is worth'. They cannot speak always as if they were upon the oath-but must be understood, speaking or writing, with some abatement. They seldom wait to mature a proposition, but even bring it to market in the green ear'. They delight to impart their defective discoveries as they arise, without waiting for their development. They are no systematizers, and would but err more by attempting it. Their minds, as I said before, are suggestive merely.

The brain of a true Caledonian (if I am not mistaken) is constituted upon quite a different plan. His Minerva'? is born in panoply!. You are never admitted to see his ideas in their growth.
Yes, indeed, they do grow, and are not rather put together upon principles of clock-work. You never catch his mind in an undress. He never hints or suggests anything, but unlades his stock of ideas in perfect order and completeness. He brings his total wealth into company, and gravely unpacks it. His riches are always about him. He never stoops to catch a glittering something in your presence to share it with you, before he quite knows whether it be true touch or not. ... He has no falterings of self-suspicion. Surmises; guesses, misgivings, half-intuitions, semi-consciousness, partial illuminations, dim instincts, embryo-conceptions, have no place in his brain or vocabulary. The twilight of dubiety never falls upon him. Is he orthodox-he has no doubts. Is he an infidel-he has none either. Between the affirmative and the negative there is no border-land with him. You cannot hover with him upon the confines of truth", or wander in the maze of a probable argument. He always keeps the path'5. You cannot make excursions with him, for he sets you right. His taste never fluctuates. His morality never abates. He cannot compromise, or understand middle actions. There can be but a right and a wrong. His conversation is as a book. His affirmations have the sanctity of an oath. You must speak upon the square' with him. He stops a metaphor like a suspected person in an enemy's country.
