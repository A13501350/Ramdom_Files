## About John Keats

Could it be that Death is also in love with poetic geniuses? Of the younger generation of English romantic poets who wrote at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Byron died young at 36, and Shelley died younger at 30. And John Keats died even younger at 26. They produced brilliant poetry and then disappeared at the prime of their poetic life, which was, much as Shakespeare says, "Brief as the lightning in the collied night, / That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth; / And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!' / The jaws of darkness do devour it up." This lamentable brevity marks John Keats's life in time, but his poetry honoured him as the greatest poet of the nineteenth century (Tennyson), much as he once said, "I think I shall be among the English poets after my death." 

Keats (1795-1821) lost his father when he was eight and his mother when he was fourteen. He was educated at Clarke's school, Enfield, where he began a translation of Virgil's The Aeneid. In 1816, Keats was licensed to practise as an apothecary, but his love of poetry made him abandon his profession for poetry. Keats's early poems, such as "O Solitude" and "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer" appeared in 1816 in the Examiner: Two years later, his long poem Endymion was published. Keats then toured the Lakes, stayed two months in Scotland, and visited Northern Ireland. He had travelled frequently in southern England. These tours moved him deeply, and he made full use of them when he came to write Hyperion. 1818 marked the "Great Year" of Keats's poetic production: he began Hyperion in its first version; he wrote "The Eve of St Agnes",
Dame sans Merci", "Ode to a Nightingale", and probably at about the same time the "Ode on a Grecian Urn", "Ode on Melancholy", and "Ode on Indolence". He also wrote "Lamia Part I", "Otho the Great", the second version of Hyperion, "To Autumn", and "Lamia Part II". In September 1820, Shelley invited Keats to Italy. Shortly afterwards, he settled in Rome where he died from tuberculosis the following February.

## About This Selection

The following is John Keats's most famous poem in English, "Ode to a Nightingale". As the poem is too beautiful to be excerpted for any reading purpose, it is presented here in full for readers' aesthetic contentment. "Ode to a Nightingale" is a poem about Keats's response to hearing the song of a nightingale. At first, he is enchanted by the bird's music but then becomes aware of his own mortality and the mutability of life. He longs to join the bird in its immortal world, but he realizes that to do so would mean losing access to beauty and joy. Ultimately, Keats returns to the mortal world, believing that this poem will achieve everlasting life.

In this poem, Keats expresses the thoughts which every reader can identify. This sense of universality, found in all of his most outstanding poetry, is generally regarded as the distinguishing feature of all great art. In this poem, Keats's word pictures, his evocation of the senses, and his subtle use of poetic language all move his readers for generations.

## 约翰·济慈


死神是否也迷恋上了那些天才诗人？说起十九世纪初英国浪漫主义时期的年轻诗人，拜伦去世时年仅36岁，雪莱离世时年方30岁。而约翰·济慈，他更年轻，却在26岁这个年纪早早辞世。他们创造了灿烂的诗篇，然后在诗歌事业鼎盛之时消逝，恰如莎士比亚所说：“犹如闪电划破夜空，在人们瞬间惊叹之前，黑暗巨口已将其吞噬。”约翰·济慈的一生短暂而悲哀，但他的诗歌使他成为十九世纪最伟大的诗人之一（如丁尼生所言），正如他曾说过的：“我想我死后或许会成为英国一位伟大诗人。”

济慈（1795-1821）在八岁时失去父亲，十四岁时又失去母亲。他在恩菲尔德的克拉克学校接受教育，在那儿他开始翻译维吉尔的《埃涅阿斯纪》。1816年，济慈取得了药剂师执照，但对诗歌的热爱使他放弃了这个职业，转而投身创作诗歌。济慈的早期诗作，如《啊，孤独》和《初读查普曼的荷马史诗》，于1816年发表在《观察家报》上；两年后，他的叙事诗《恩迪米翁》面世。随后，济慈游历湖区，逗留苏格兰两个月，还造访北爱尔兰。他频繁往返英格兰南部。这些旅行深深地触动了他，也为他后来的作品《海伯利安》提供了丰富的灵感。

1818年成为济慈诗歌创作的“伟大一年”：他开创了《海伯利安》的初稿；创作了《圣艾格尼丝之夜》、《无情的圣母》、《夜莺颂》，大约在同一时期完成了《希腊古瓮颂》、《忧郁颂》和《懒惰颂》。他还创作了《拉米亚第一部分》、《大奥托》、《海伯利安》的第二版、《致秋天》和《拉米亚第二部分》。1820年9月，雪莱邀请济慈前往意大利。不久之后，他定居罗马，并于次年2月因患肺结核病离世。

一

`   `

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains

我的心在痛，困盹和麻木

My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,

刺进了感官，有如饮过毒鸩，

Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains

又像是刚刚把鸦片吞服，

One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:

于是向着列斯忘川下沉：

'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,

并不是我嫉妒你的好运，

But being too happy in thine happiness—

而是你的快乐使我太欢欣——

That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,

　　因为在林间嘹亮的天地里，

In some melodious plot

　　　你啊，轻翅的仙灵，

Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,

你躲进山毛榉的葱绿和荫影，

Singest of summer in full-throated ease.

放开了歌喉，歌唱着夏季。

`   `

`   `

Oh, for a draught of vintage! That hath been

唉，要是有一口酒！那冷藏

Cooled a long age in the deep-delved earth,

在地下多年的清醇饮料，

Tasting of Flora and the country green,

一尝就令人想起绿色之邦，

Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!

想起花神，恋歌，阳光和舞蹈！

Oh, for a beaker full of the warm South,

要是有一杯南国的温暖

Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,

充满了鲜红的灵感之泉，

With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,

　　杯沿明灭着珍珠的泡沫，

And purple-stained mouth,

　　　给嘴唇染上紫斑；

That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,

哦，我要一饮而悄然离开尘寰，

And with thee fade away into the forest dim:

和你同去幽暗的林中隐没：

`   `

III

三

`   `

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget

远远地、远远隐没，让我忘掉

What thou among the leaves hast never known,

你在树叶间从不知道的一切，

The weariness, the fever, and the fret

忘记这疲劳、热病，和焦躁，

Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;

这使人对坐而悲叹的世界；

Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,

在这里，青春苍白、削瘦、死亡，

Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;

而“瘫痪”有几根白发在摇摆；

Where but to think is to be full of sorrow

　　在这里，稍一思索就充满了

And leaden-eyed despairs;

　　　忧伤和灰眼的绝望，

Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,

而“美”保持不住明眸的光彩，

Or new Love pine at them beyond tomorrow.

新生的爱情活不到明天就枯凋。

`   `

Away! away! For I will fly to thee,

去吧！去吧！我要朝你飞去，

Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,

不用和酒神坐文豹的车驾，

But on the viewless wings of Poesy,

我要展开诗歌的无形羽翼，

Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:

尽管这头脑已经困顿、疲乏；

Already with thee! Tender is the night,

去了！啊，我已经和你同往！

And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,

夜这般温柔，月后正登上宝座，

Clustered around by all her starry fays;

　　周围是侍卫她的一群星星；

But here there is no light,

　　　但这儿却不甚明亮，

Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown

除了有一线天光，被微风带过

Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.

葱绿的幽暗，和苔藓的曲径。

`   `

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,

我看不出是哪种花草在脚旁，

Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,

什么清香的花挂在树枝上；

But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet

在温馨的幽暗里，我只能猜想

Wherewith the seasonable month endows

这个时令该把哪种芬芳

The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;

赋予这果树、林莽，和草丛，

White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;

这白枳花，和田野的玫瑰，

Fast-fading violets covered up in leaves;

　　这绿叶堆中易谢的紫罗兰，

And mid-May's eldest child,

　　　还有五月中旬的骄宠，

The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,

这缀满了露酒的麝香蔷薇，

The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.0

它成了夏夜蚊蚋的嗡营的港湾。

`   `

Darkling I listen; and, for many a time

我在黑暗里倾听；啊，多少次

I have been half in love with easeful Death,

我几乎爱上了静谧的死亡，

Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme,

我在诗思里用尽了好的言辞，

To take into the air my quiet breath;

求他把我的一息散入空茫；

Now more than ever seems it rich to die, 5

而现在，哦，死更是多么富丽：

To cease upon the midnight with no pain,

在午夜里溘然魂离人间，

While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad

　　当你正倾泻着你的心怀

In such an ecstasy!

　　　发出这般的狂喜！

Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—

你仍将歌唱，但我却不再听见——

To thy high requiem become a sod.

你的葬歌只能唱给泥草一块。

`   `

Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird!

永生的鸟啊，你不会死去！

No hungry generations tread thee down;

饥饿的世代无法将你蹂躏；

The voice I hear this passing night was heard

今夜，我偶然听到的歌曲

In ancient days by emperor and clown:

曾使古代的帝王和村夫喜悦，

Perhaps the self-same song that found a path65

或许这同样的歌也曾激荡

Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,

露丝忧郁的心，使她不禁落泪，

She stood in tears amid the alien corn;

　　站在异邦的谷田里想着家；

The same that oft-times hath

　　　就是这声音常常

Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam

在失掉了的仙域里引动窗扉：

Of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn.70

一个美女望着大海险恶的浪花。

`   `

VIII

八

`   `

Forlorn! The very word is like a bell

啊，失掉了！这句话好比一声钟

To toll me back from thee to my sole self!

使我猛省到我站脚的地方！

Adieu! The fancy cannot cheat so well

别了！幻想，这骗人的妖童，

As she is famed to do, deceiving elf.

不能老耍弄它盛传的伎俩。

Adieu! adieu! Thy plaintive anthem fades75

别了！别了！你怨诉的歌声

Past the near meadows, over the still stream,

流过草坪，越过幽静的溪水，

Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep

　　溜上山坡；而此时，它正深深

In the next valley-glades:

　　　埋在附近的溪谷中：

Was it a vision, or a waking dream?

噫，这是个幻觉，还是梦寐？

Fled is that music: —Do I wake or sleep?80

那歌声去了：——我是睡？是醒？
