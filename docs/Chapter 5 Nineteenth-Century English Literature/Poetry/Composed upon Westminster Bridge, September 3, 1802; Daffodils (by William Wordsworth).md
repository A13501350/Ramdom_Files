## About This Selection
Presented in the following are two poems by William Wordsworth. The first one is his famous sonnet "Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802". The subject matter of this poem is unique. In most of his poetry, Wordsworth describes natural scenes: streams, hills, mountains, woods, meadows, country lasses, and shepherd boys mostly in the Lake District in northwestern England. Wordsworth usually pictures cities in general, and London in particular, as the opposite of the country and nature. He likes to celebrate his escape from a city and describes the ugliness and depravity of London. It is unusual, therefore, that in this poem, Wordsworth finds the city as beautiful as natural scenery. This poem finds beauty and serenity in a quiet early-morning in London when the usual hustle and bustle of the big commercial city is suspended. The poet finds joy in this unusually quiet scene. Readers who have visited London may find in this poem part of their life experience with aesthetic enjoyment. But when they come to read other writers/poets such as E. M. Forster, Joseph Conrad, and T. S. Eliot, who also write about London (see pages 305, 312 and 460 of this book), they will see a scene quite the opposite.
The other poem, "Daffodils", also known as "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud", is never absent from any anthology of English literature, for it is an iconic work of English Romantic poetry.
Wordsworth composed the poem after he came across a "crowd" of daffodils along the shore of a lake while on a walk near his home in the Lake District of England. In expounding his emotional response to this memory, Wordsworth emphasizes nature's lasting influence on human souls. He thus illustrates how this image of the dancing daffodils provides a nurturing source and delight for his later reflection and solitude. Readers may find the companionship of nature, the endurance of memory, and the richness of sensation in the poem. The poet's initial sense of solitude gives way to a feeling of companionship with the beauty of nature. The image of the daffodils awakes the speaker's memory, and his inner tranquillity is recollected in the meantime, which sheds light on the beautiful things in nature. In the process, the senses, particularly vision, inspire the poet's imagination.

本次将介绍威廉·华兹华斯的两首诗作。首先，是他著名的十四行诗《威斯敏斯特桥上作》。这首诗的主题别具一格。华兹华斯在众多诗作中，常常描绘自然景观：流水、山丘、山脉、森林、草地、乡村景致、田园少女和牧童，这些场景多见于英格兰西北部的湖区。他通常将城市，尤其是伦敦，描绘成乡村和自然的对立面。他热衷于赞美逃离都市生活，描述伦敦的丑陋和颓废。
因此，在这首诗中，华兹华斯认为城市和自然景观同样美丽，这一观点颇为独特。在伦敦一个宁静清晨，通常被熙来攘往的商业城市的喧嚣所替代，诗人在此时此刻找到了美和宁静。那异常静谧的画面中，诗人感受到了喜悦。曾历经伦敦的读者可能会在这首诗中找到自己人生经历的一角，获得审美愉悦。然而，当他们阅读到其他作家/诗人，如 E. M. 福斯特、约瑟夫·康拉德和 T. S. 艾略特等人的作品时，这些作品描绘的伦敦（见本书第 305、312 和 460 页），则呈现出完全相反的景象。

另一首诗作《水仙花》，也被称为《我孤独地漫游，像一朵云》，早已成为英国文学选集中的常驻之作，因其是英国浪漫主义诗歌的代表作之一。 在英格兰湖区散步时，华兹华斯在湖边发现了“一大群”水仙花，这段经历启发了这首诗的创作。在表达对这段回忆的情感反应时，华兹华斯强调了自然对人灵魂的持久影响。因此，他描述了这些舞动水仙花的形象如何一直滋养着他的思考和孤独，给予他愉悦。
读者将在这首诗中领略大自然的陪伴、记忆的永恒和情感的多彩。诗人最初的孤独感转变为对自然之美的陶醉。水仙花的形象唤起了说者的回忆，同时勾起内心深处的宁静感，使他意识到大自然的美好。在这个过程中，感官，尤其是视觉，激发了诗人的想象力。

### Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802

威廉·华兹华斯（William Wordsworth）

威斯敏斯特桥上
杨德豫 译

```

Earth has not anything to show more fair:

大地再没有比这儿更美的风貌：

Dull would he be of soul who could pass by

若有谁，对如此壮丽动人的景物

A sight so touching in its majesty:

竟无动于衷，那才是灵魂麻木；

This City now doth, like a garment, wear

瞧这座城市，像披上一领新袍，

The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,

披上了明艳的晨光；环顾周遭：

Ships, towers, domes, theaters, and temples lie

船舶，尖塔，剧院，教堂，华屋，

Open unto the fields, and to the sky;

都寂然、坦然，向郊野、向天穹赤露，

All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.

在烟尘未染的大气里粲然闪耀。

Never did sun more beautifully steep

旭日金挥洒布于峡谷山陵，

In his first splendor, valley, rock, or hill;

也不比这片晨光更为奇丽；

Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!

我何尝见过、感受过这深沉的宁静！

The river glideth at his own sweet will:

河上徐流，由着自己的心意；

Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;

上帝呵！千门万户都沉睡未醒，

And all that mighty heart is lying still!

这整个宏大的心脏仍然在歇息！
```

### I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (Daffodils)

威廉·华兹华斯（William Wordsworth）

我孤独地漫游，像一朵云

飞白 译

```

I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud

我孤独地漫游，像一朵云

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

在山丘和谷地上飘荡，

When all at once I saw a crowd,

忽然间我看见一群

A host, of golden daffodils;

金色的水仙花迎春开放，

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

在树荫下，在湖水边，

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

迎着微风起舞翩翩。

`   `

Continuous as the stars that shine

连绵不绝，如繁星灿烂，

And twinkle on the milky way,

在银河里闪闪发光，

They stretched in never-ending line

它们沿着湖湾的边缘

Along the margin of a bay:

延伸成无穷无尽的一行；

Ten thousand saw I at a glance,

我一眼看见了一万朵，

Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

在欢舞之中起伏颠簸。

`   `

The waves beside them danced; but they

粼粼波光也在跳着舞，

Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:

水仙的欢欣却胜过水波；

A poet could not but be gay,

与这样快活的伴侣为伍，

In such a jocund company:

诗人怎能不满心欢乐！

I gazed--and gazed--but little thought

我久久凝望，却想象不到

What wealth the show to me had brought:

这奇景赋予我多少财宝，——

`   `

For oft, when on my couch I lie

每当我躺在床上不眠，

In vacant or in pensive mood,

或心神空茫，或默默沉思，

They flash upon that inward eye

它们常在心灵中闪现，

Which is the bliss of solitude;

那是孤独之中的福祉；

And then my heart with pleasure fills,

于是我的心便涨满幸福，

And dances with the daffodils.

和水仙一同翩翩起舞。
