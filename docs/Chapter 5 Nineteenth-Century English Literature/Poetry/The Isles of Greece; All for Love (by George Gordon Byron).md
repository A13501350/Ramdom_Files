## About George Gordon Byron

George Gordon Byron (1788-1824) was born in London. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he began to form his ideals of political and personal liberty. As early as 1807, Byron published Hours of Idleness. Two years later, in English Bards and Scotch Reviewers, he criticized William Wordsworth and others of the "Lake Poets" Soon he travelled to Portugal, Spain, Albania, and Greece. This trip inspired him to begin writing Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.

Then he travelled further in Turkey and Greece and returned to England in 1811. In 1812, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage was published. "I awoke one morning and found myself famous," Byron wrote. Young, handsome, aristocratic and flamboyant, Byron then got involved in numerous scandalous affairs. Byron again left England, this time never to return. Byron spent the summer of 1816 in Switzerland with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein.

The first two cantos of his long poem Don Juan were published in July 1819. Byron then turned his attention to the Greek cause of independence from the Ottoman Empire. He soon became severely ill. On April 19, 1824, Byron died, honoured as a national hero in Greece. Byron is a complex poet; he is in many ways an embodiment of the Romantic hero comic, nihilistic, and yet a popular and talented radical. Knowledge of Lord Byron's private behaviour, beliefs, and supposed immorality will likely lead to different opinions and readings about his work. But in general, readers of Byron may find these recurrent themes in his works: nature versus civilization, political oppression, military aggression, sexual repression, and even the superficial restraints of a frivolous, silly English society. Among these, a common theme in Byron's lyrics is undoubtedly that of love in its many manifestations: illicit love, idyllic love, sexual repression, sexual decadence, thwarted love, and marriage.

乔治·戈登·拜伦（1788-1824年）出生于伦敦。他进入剑桥大学三一学院，在那里他开始形成自己关于政治和个人自由的理想。早在1807年，拜伦出版了《无所事事的时光》。两年后，在《英国吟游诗人和苏格兰评论家》中，他批评了威廉·华兹华斯等“湖畔诗人”。不久他前往葡萄牙、西班牙、阿尔巴尼亚和希腊。这次旅行激发了他开始写《哈罗德的朝圣》。 然后他继续前往土耳其和希腊，并于1811年回到英国。1812年，《哈罗德的朝圣》出版。拜伦写道：“有一天早晨醒来，发现自己成名了。”年轻、英俊、贵族出身、华丽夸张，拜伦随后卷入了众多丑闻。拜伦再次离开英格兰，这次永不返回。1816年夏天，拜伦与《弗兰肯斯坦》作者珀西·比希·雪莱和玛丽·雪莱一起在瑞士度过。 他的长诗《唐璜》的前两卷于1819年7月出版。随后，拜伦将注意力转向了希腊人民从奥斯曼帝国独立的事业。他很快病重。 1824年4月19日，拜伦逝世，被希腊尊为民族英雄。拜伦是一位复杂的诗人；在许多方面，他是浪漫主义英雄的具体体现，既喜剧性、虚无主义，又是一位受欢迎且有才华的激进人士。了解拜伦勋爵的私人行为、信仰和据称的不道德行为可能会导致对他的作品有不同的看法和解读。但总的来说，拜伦的读者可能会在他的作品中找到这些经常出现的主题：自然与文明的对立、政治压迫、军事侵略、性压抑，甚至肤浅的英国社会的约束。在这些主题中，拜伦歌词中一个常见的主题无疑是爱的各种表现形式：禁忌之爱、田园爱情、性压抑、性堕落、受阻爱情和婚姻。

以下是拜伦的两首诗。第一首是拜伦在《唐璜》第三卷中的著名抒情诗节选，这是一首长达一万六千行的长诗。拜伦称《唐璜》为“史诗讽刺”，它基于唐璜的传说，一个表面上花花公子的人却很容易被女人勾引。在名为《哀希腊》的这五首诗节中，拜伦呼吁希腊人从奴役中起身，摆脱奥斯曼帝国的暴政，但他最终陷入绝望。他回忆起这些岛屿光荣的过去和神话传说。他在诗中提到了“萨拉米斯”和“马拉松”。他还提到“波斯之墓”，指的是当数量极少的希腊军队击败强大的波斯帝国时的情景。拜伦讽刺地展示了波斯国王的庞大舰队如何在萨拉米斯的一天血腥战斗中被摧毁，但他悲叹希腊的过去荣耀已逝，它的“英雄胸怀不再跳动！” 

第二首诗是拜伦在意大利之旅途中从佛罗伦萨到比萨时创作的。这首诗的语调与《希腊群岛》不同。在这里，拜伦以更温和但仍果断的声音，向美丽和爱情致诗。他宣称人生最美好的时光是青春时期，而不是成就辉煌时期。诗人将名声拟人化，并直接向名声发表讲话。年轻人喜欢成名，因为他们会看到自己心爱之人眼中的光芒。这就是年轻人渴望成名的原因。名声最好在心爱之人年轻时享受。换句话说，名声主要在心爱之人的眼中追求。当获得者年迈时，名声就不再是名声。
## About This Selection

Presented below are two poems by Byron. The first one is an excerpt from Byron's famous lyric in Canto IlI of Don Juan, a long poem composed of over sixteen thousand lines of verse. Byron called Don Juan an "Epic Satire". It is based on the legend of Don Juan, a seeming womanizer who is, reversely, easily seduced by women. In these five stanzas entitled "The Isles of Greece", Byron calls for the Greeks to rise from their servitude and free themselves from the tyrannical rule of the Ottomans, but he ends in despair. He recalls the isles' glorious past and mythology. He refers to "Salamis" and "Marathon" in his poem. He also mentions "the Persians' grave" as a reference to a time when the vastly outnumbered Greek forces defeated the mighty Persian Empire. Byron shows satirically how the Persian king's mighty fleets were wiped out during a day's bloody fight at Salamis, but he laments that Greece's past glory is dead, and its "heroic bosom beats no more!" 

The second poem in this selection was composed when Byron was travelling between Florence and Pisa during his Italian tour. This lyric's tone differs from that of "The Isles of Greece". Here, in a gentler but still peremptory voice, Byron addresses this poem to beauty and love in relation to youthfulness. He declares that the best days of one's life are the days of his youth, not the ones when fame is achieved. The poet has personified fame and has directly addressed fame. Young men delight in becoming famous because they would see the glow in their beloveds' eyes. That is the reason why a young man longs to gain fame. Fame is best enjoyed when the beloved enjoys it at a young age. In other words, fame is sought mainly in the eyes of the beloved. Fame is not fame when the achiever is old.

### The Isles of Greece (An Excerpt) 

哀希腊穆旦 译

```
一

The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!

希腊群岛呵，美丽的希腊群岛！

Where burning Sappho loved and sung,

热情的萨弗在这里唱过恋歌；

Where grew the arts of war and peace,

在这里，战争与和平的艺术并兴，

Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!

狄洛斯崛起，阿波罗跃出海面！

Eternal summer gilds them yet,

永恒的夏天还把海岛镀成金，

But all, except their sun, is set.

可是除了太阳，一切已经消沉。

  

二

The Scian and the Teian muse,

开奥的缪斯，蒂奥的缪斯，

The hero's harp, the lover's lute,

那英雄的竖琴，恋人的琵琶，

Have found the fame your shores refuse;

原在你的岸上博得了声誉，

Their place of birth alone is mute

而今在这发源地反倒喑哑；

To sounds which echo further west

呵，那歌声已远远向西流传，

Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'

远超过你祖先的“海岛乐园”。

  

三

The mountains look on Marathon—

起伏的山峦望着马拉松－

And Marathon looks on the sea;

马拉松望着茫茫的海波；

And musing there an hour alone,

我独自在那里冥想一刻钟，

I dream'd that Greece might still be free;

梦想希腊仍旧自由而欢乐；

For standing on the Persians' grave,

因为，当我在波斯墓上站立，

I could not deem myself a slave.

我不能想象自己是个奴隶。

  

四

A king sate on the rocky brow

一个国王高高坐在石山顶，

Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;

了望着萨拉密挺立于海外；

And ships, by thousands, lay below,

千万只船舶在山下靠停，

And men in nations;—all were his!

还有多少队伍全由他统率！

He counted them at break of day—

他在天亮时把他们数了数，

And when the sun set where were they?

但日落的时候他们都在何处？

  

五

And where are they? and where art thou,

呵，他们而今安在？还有你呢，

My country? On thy voiceless shore

我的祖国？在无声的土地上，

The heroic lay is tuneless now—

英雄的颂歌如今已沉寂－

The heroic bosom beats no more!

那英雄的心也不再激荡！

And must thy lyre, so long divine,

难道你一向庄严的竖琴，

Degenerate into hands like mine?

竟至沦落到我的手里弹弄？
```

### All for Love

写于佛罗伦萨至比萨途中
张子健 译

```

Oh, talk not to me of a name great in story;

哦，别跟我谈论故事中那些伟大的名字，

The days of our youth are the days of our glory;

年轻时的岁月就是我们辉煌的岁月：

And the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty

甜蜜的二十二岁的常春藤和桃金娘

Are worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.

比得上你所有的桂冠，不管它们曾经有多少。



What are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?

对布满皱纹的额头来说，花冠和王冠又算得了什么？

’Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled:

那不过是洒上五月朝露的一朵死花。

Then away with all such from the head that is hoary！

不如把这一切从苍白的头上扔掉！

What care I for the wreaths that can only give glory?

对于象征荣誉的花环我又有什么好在乎的呢？



O Fame! —If I e'er took delight in thy praises,

哦，美名！如果我曾从你的赞扬中得到欣喜，

’Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,

那并不仅仅是为了你夸夸其谈的辞句，

Than to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover

我是想看到心上人明亮的双眼，

She thought that I was not unworthy to love her.

她认为我并非一无是处。



There chiefly I sought thee, there only I found thee;

主要是因为这个，我才追寻你，也只有我能发现你，

Her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee;

她的目光是围绕着你的最美的光线；

When it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story,

如果听到我灿烂的故事，她的眼睛闪亮，

I knew it was love, and I felt it was glory.

我知道那就是爱，我感觉那才是荣耀。
