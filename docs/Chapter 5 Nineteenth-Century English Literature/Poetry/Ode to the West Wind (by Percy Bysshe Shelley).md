## About Percy Bysshe Shelley
Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) was active, mischievous, and highly imaginative as a child. He was educated at Eton, and University College, Oxford. At school, he was mocked and bullied as "Mad Shelley". At Oxford, he read radical authors, dressed and behaved against conventional fashion. He quarrelled violently with his father. At 19, Shelley eloped to Scotland with 16-year-old Harriet Westbrook and married her. 

It was this unconventional, rebellious, seemingly eccentric disposition and behaviour, together with his gift of imagination and creativity, that made a great poet known to the world. Shelley wrote and published his poetry as early as 1810. Much of his early philosophy in poetry and politics is expressed in Queen Mab (1813), which shows Shelley as the direct heir to the French and British revolutionary intellectuals of the 1790s. In the meantime, Shelley's family life was a mess. In the autumn of 1816, Harriet drowned herself.

Shelley immediately married Mary Godwin, who later wrote Frankenstein. Despite his domestic problems and financial troubles, Shelley proliferated in writing his poetry, lyric dramas, and essays. The twelve months from the summer of 1819 saw Shelley's most extraordinary burst of major poetry. He completed Prometheus Unbound (published 1820). He wrote The Mask of Anarchy, "Ode to the West Wind", Peter Bell the Third (all written 1819); "Ode to Liberty", "Ode to Naples", "To a Skylark", "The Cloud", and "The Witch of Atlas" (all written 1820). He also wrote " Song to the Men of England", and "Sonnet: England 1819". His famous A Defence of Poetry was written in 1821. Shelley got drowned in August 1822 on a return trip from visiting Byron. 
Shelley was a poet who hailed the French Revolution and who despised the reactionary politics of the post-revolutionary period. He worked tirelessly to inspire the human soul for freedom, peace, and love, which he deeply desired. He saw the poet as a reforming prophet for the perfect, eternal truth. In his preface to Prometheus Unbound, he wrote that he had "a passion for reforming the world". He died young, at twenty-nine. Still, he has been the symbolic embodiment of youthful rebellion for generations of liberal reformers in England.
## About This Selection

This selection for Shelley presents his famous "Ode to the West Wind" unabridged. In this powerfully passionate poem, Shelley uses five cantos or chapters (with four stanzas of three lines and an ending couplet each) to express three main themes, namely, the power of nature, the power of poetry, and the cycle of life. The West Wind's power and beauty, strong as it is, are resisted by hostile forces. This creates tension in the poem. Shelley views the destructive power of the West Wind as a metaphorical parallel for the beauty of his poetry, which he worries is similarly doomed to be neglected or forgotten. The destructive power of the West Wind is but a part of a larger cycle in which death is merely a necessary stage in the process of regeneration that perpetuates life itself. 
In the poem, the image of the wild, proud, untamed wind is seen as an embodiment of the poet himself, the perfect symbol for and the impetuous agent of radical social change. The final line of the poem is universally famous. It sounds like an anthem for advancing years, death, and a rebirth into higher consciousness (a favorite theme in Romantic literature): "If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?”

## 关于珀西·比希·雪莱

珀西·比希·雪莱 (1792-1822) 小时候活泼、淘气、想象力丰富。他曾就读于伊顿公学和牛津大学学院。在学校里，他被嘲笑和欺负为“疯子雪莱”。在牛津，他阅读激进作家的作品，穿着和行为都与传统时尚背道而驰。他与父亲发生激烈争吵。19 岁时，雪莱与 16 岁的哈丽特·韦斯特布鲁克私奔到苏格兰并与她结婚。 正是这种不拘一格、叛逆、看似古怪的性格和行为，加上他丰富的想象力和创造力，让这位伟大的诗人闻名于世。

雪莱早在 1810 年就写作并出版了他的诗歌。他早期的诗歌和政治哲学大部分都体现在《玛布女王》(1813) 中，该书表明雪莱是 1790 年代法国和英国革命知识分子的直接继承人。与此同时，雪莱的家庭生活一团糟。1816 年秋天，哈丽特投河自尽。 雪莱随即娶了玛丽·戈德温，后者后来创作了《弗兰肯斯坦》。尽管雪莱家庭生活和经济困难重重，但他的诗歌、抒情剧和散文创作却源源不断。从 1819 年夏天开始的十二个月里，雪莱的诗歌创作达到了顶峰。他完成了《解放了的普罗米修斯》（1820 年出版）。他写了《无政府的面具》、《西风颂》和《彼得·贝尔三世》（均写于 1819 年）；《自由颂》、《那不勒斯颂》、《致云雀》、《云》和《阿特拉斯女巫》（均写于 1820 年）。他还写了《献给英格兰人的歌》和《十四行诗：1819 年的英格兰》。他著名的《为诗辩护》写于 1821 年。1822 年 8 月，雪莱在拜访拜伦归来的途中溺水身亡。

雪莱是一位诗人，他赞扬法国大革命，鄙视革命后时期的反动政治。他孜孜不倦地激励人类灵魂追求他深切渴望的自由、和平和爱。他认为诗人是完美、永恒真理的改革先知。在《解放了的普罗米修斯》的序言中，他写道，他“热衷于改革世界”。他英年早逝，年仅 29 岁。尽管如此，他仍然是英国几代自由改革者心中年轻叛逆的象征。

## 关于此选集

雪莱的选集完整呈现了他著名的《西风颂》。在这首充满激情的诗中，雪莱用五个篇章（每个篇章有四个三行诗节和一个结尾对句）表达了三个主要主题，即自然的力量、诗歌的力量和生命的循环。西风的力量和美丽虽然强大，但却遭到敌对力量的抵抗。这在诗中产生了紧张气氛。

雪莱将西风的破坏力视为他诗歌之美的隐喻，他担心他的诗歌同样注定会被忽视或遗忘。西风的破坏力只是一个更大循环的一部分，在这个循环中，死亡只是再生过程的一个必要阶段，而再生过程可以延续生命本身。 在诗中，狂野、骄傲、不羁的风的形象被视为诗人自己的化身，是激进社会变革的完美象征和冲动推动者。这首诗的最后一行举世闻名。它听起来像是一首赞美岁月流逝、死亡和重生至更高意识（浪漫主义文学中最受欢迎的主题）的赞歌：“如果冬天来了，春天还会远吗？”

O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being,

哦，狂暴的西风，秋之生命的呼吸！

Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead

你无形，但枯死的落叶被你横扫，

Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,

有如鬼魅碰到了巫师，纷纷逃避：



Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,

黄的，黑的，灰的，红得像患肺痨，

Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,

呵，重染疫疠的一群：西风呵，是你

Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed

以车驾把有翼的种子催送到



The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,

黑暗的冬床上，它们就躺在那里，

Each like a corpse within its grave, until

像是墓中的死穴，冰冷，深藏，低贱，

Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow

直等到春天，你碧空的姊妹吹起



Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill

她的喇叭，在沉睡的大地上响遍，

(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)

（唤出嫩芽，象羊群一样，觅食空中）

With living hues and odours plain and hill:

将色和香充满了山峰和平原。 　



Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;

不羁的精灵呵，你无处不远行；

Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!

破坏者兼保护者：听吧，你且聆听！

Thou on whose stream, ‘mid the steep sky’s commotion,

没入你的急流，当高空一片混乱，

Loose clouds like Earth’s decaying leaves are shed,

流云象大地的枯叶一样被撕扯

Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,

脱离天空和海洋的纠缠的枝干。 　



Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread

成为雨和电的使者：它们飘落

On the blue surface of thine airy surge,

在你的磅礴之气的蔚蓝的波面，

Like the bright hair uplifted from the head

有如狂女的飘扬的头发在闪烁，



Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge

从天穹的最遥远而模糊的边沿

Of the horizon to the zenith’s height,

直抵九霄的中天，到处都在摇曳

The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge

欲来雷雨的卷发，对濒死的一年 　



Of the dying year, to which this closing night

你唱出了葬歌，而这密集的黑夜

Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre

将成为它广大墓陵的一座圆顶，

Vaulted with all thy congregated might

里面正有你的万钧之力的凝结； 　



Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere

那是你的浑然之气，从它会迸涌

Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!

黑色的雨，冰雹和火焰：哦，你听！

Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams

是你，你将蓝色的地中海唤醒，

The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,

而它曾经昏睡了一整个夏天，

Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,

被澄澈水流的回旋催眠入梦， 　



Beside a pumice isle in Baiae’s bay,

就在巴亚海湾的一个浮石岛边，

And saw in sleep old palaces and towers

它梦见了古老的宫殿和楼阁

Quivering within the wave's intenser day,

在水天辉映的波影里抖颤， 　



All overgrown with azure moss and flowers

而且都生满青苔、开满花朵，

So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou

那芬芳真迷人欲醉！呵，为了给你

For whose path the Atlantic’s level powers

让一条路，大西洋的汹涌的浪波 　



Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below

把自己向两边劈开，而深在渊底

The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear

那海洋中的花草和泥污的森林

The sapless foliage of the ocean, know

虽然枝叶扶疏，却没有精力； 　



Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear,

听到你的声音，它们已吓得发青：

And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!

一边颤栗，一边自动萎缩：哦，你听！

If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;

哎，假如我是一片枯叶被你浮起，

If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;

假如我是能和你飞跑的云雾，

A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share

是一个波浪，和你的威力同喘息， 　



The impulse of thy strength, only less free

假如我分有你的脉搏，仅仅不如

Than thou, O Uncontrollable! If even

你那么自由，哦，无法约束的生命！

I were as in my boyhood, and could be

假如我能像在少年时，凌风而舞 　



The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,

便成了你的伴侣，悠游天空

As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed

（因为呵，那时候，要想追你上云霄，

Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne’er have striven

似乎并非梦幻），我就不致像如今 　



As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.

这样焦躁地要和你争相祈祷。

Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!

哦，举起我吧，当我是水波、树叶、浮云！

I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!

我跌在生活底荆棘上，我流血了！ 　



A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed

这被岁月的重轭所制服的生命

One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.

原是和你一样：骄傲、轻捷而不驯。

Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:

把我当作你的竖琴吧，有如树林：

What if my leaves are falling like its own!

尽管我的叶落了，那有什么关系！

The tumult of thy mighty harmonies

你巨大的合奏所振起的音乐 　



Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,

将染有树林和我的深邃的秋意：

Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,

虽忧伤而甜蜜。呵，但愿你给予我

My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!

狂暴的精神！奋勇者呵，让我们合一！ 　



Drive my dead thoughts over the universe

请把我枯死的思想向世界吹落，

Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!

让它像枯叶一样促成新的生命！

And, by the incantation of this verse,

哦，请听从这一篇符咒似的诗歌， 　



Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth

就把我的话语，像是灰烬和火星

Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!

从还未熄灭的炉火向人间播散！

Be through my lips to unawakened Earth

让预言的喇叭通过我的嘴唇 　



The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,

把昏睡的大地唤醒吧！要是冬天

If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?

已经来了，西风呵，春日怎能遥远？
