## About Emily Brontë

Emily Brontë (1818-1848) briefly attended school in 1824 for less than a year and was then educated at home. She loved the moorland near her home at Haworth and often sat alone in the heath, musing and imagining. In 1838, she probably became a governess at Law Hill, near Halifax, and in 1842 spent nine months in Brussels with Charlotte, studying French, German, and music. She returned at the end of the year to Haworth, where she spent the rest of her life. In 1845 Charlotte "discovered" Emily's poems and projected a joint publication, Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell, which appeared in 1846. Emily's novel Wuthering Heights was published in 1847. Unlike Charlotte's Jane Eyre, it met with more incomprehension than recognition, and it was only after Emily's death that it became widely acknowledged as a masterpiece. Emily is now established as one of the most original poets of the century for her lyrics. And Wuthering Heights, which was at first regarded by many as excessively morbid and violent, was gradually reassessed, and by 1899 some literary critics began to praise Emily's masterly fusion of romance and realism in contrast to her sister's didacticism in Jane Eyre. In the twentieth century, Emily Brontë has become a figure of legend. She was described as a passionate genius of almost mythic proportions, possessing supreme will and strength. And her Wuthering Heights is read for its innovative writing style that conveys energy, emotion, and even violence that has ever been tried by woman writers of her time.

## About Wuthering Heights

This is a novel that appears to be morbid, painful and violent. It shows a distorted mind that seeks revenge in death. After an introductory narration of the haunted Wuthering Heights, Nelly Dean, the housekeeper of Thrusheross Grange, tells the eventful and restless life there. The novelist unfolds a tale of exceptional emotional and imaginative force through flashbacks and time shifts.
Mr Earnshaw, the original owner of Wuthering Heights, brings home an orphan named Heathcliff. He rears the boy as one of his own children. Then the elder Earnshaw dies, leaving Heathcliff to his son Hindley's repeated bullying and humiliation. Heathcliff chooses to stay away from Hindley but finds himself in love with Earnshaw's daughter Catherine. One night, Heathcliff, overhearing Catherine tell Nelly that she cannot marry him because it would degrade her, leaves the Heights. He returns a wealthy man three years later, only to find Catherine has married Edgar Linton at Thrusheross Grange. Heathcliff decides to take revenge. He marries Edgar's sister Isabella and ill-treats her, and hastens Catherine's death while she is giving birth to her daughter, Cathy. He treats Hindley violently. Edgar Linton dies. Heathcliff forces a marriage between Cathy and his son Linton in order to secure the Linton property. Young Linton also dies. By then, Heathcliff's desire for revenge is done, and he longs to reunite with Catherine in the grave. He dies with a wish that the two families at Wuthering Heights and the Thrusheross Grange will be united in the next generation.

## About This Selection


The following episode is from Chapter 3 of the novel. It is composed mainly of two dreams. The first dream is riotous in action, comic in tone, but symbolic in meaning; the second is horrible and expository of the sins committed in Wuthering Heights. 

In the first, Mr Lockwood dreams of listening to a long-winded preach by a clergyman named Jabez Branderham; he quarrels with the preacher and gets involved in a riotous fight with him and his listeners. Though religious enough, Lockwood and Jabez Branderham are unwilling to pardon each other but plunge themselves outright into violence. This dream, therefore, symbolically gives the novel's theme: violence can lurk just under the surface, even in those who are pious believers of the faith, while mercy and forgiveness are readily forgotten. 

In the second dream, Mr Lockwood hears an annoying sound caused by a tree branch outside the windowpanes in the wind and snow. He tries to stretch out his hand to stop the noise, but instead of catching the branch, his hand is grabbed by "a little, ice-cold hand" of Catherine Linton, who sobs most morbidly, "Let me in, let me in!" Violence and bloodshed ensue. The dreamer wakes up in horror to face a cold Heathcliff who comes with a candle. This event creates the background of horror for what will soon be unfolded by the novelist through another narrator. The ghostly atmosphere is evocative of Gothic novels in English literature.

## 艾米莉·勃朗特简介

艾米莉·勃朗特（1818-1848）虽然只在 1824 年短暂上学不到一年，但之后便在家接受教育。她深爱哈沃斯家附近的荒原，经常独自坐在那里沉思和幻想。1838 年，她很可能成为哈利法克斯附近劳希尔家的家庭教师，并于 1842 年与夏洛特在布鲁塞尔度过了九个月，学习法语、德语和音乐。年底她回到哈沃斯，在那里度过了余生。夏洛特在 1845 年“发现”了艾米莉的诗歌，并计划出版一本合著的《柯勒、埃利斯和阿克顿·贝尔诗集》，该书于 1846 年问世。艾米莉的小说《呼啸山庄》则于 1847 年出版。与夏洛特的《简·爱》不同，人们对它的不解多于认可，直到艾米莉去世后，它才被广泛认为是杰作。艾米莉现在因其抒情诗而被公认为本世纪最具独创性的诗人之一。

《呼啸山庄》最初被许多人认为过于病态和暴力，后来逐渐被重新评价，到 1899 年，一些文学评论家开始称赞艾米莉巧妙地融合了浪漫和现实主义，与她姐姐在《简·爱》中的说教形成鲜明对比。在二十世纪，艾米莉·勃朗特已成为传奇人物。她被描述为一个充满激情的天才，几乎是神话般的人物，拥有超凡的意志和力量。她的《呼啸山庄》因其创新的写作风格而被人们阅读，这种写作风格传达了她那个时代女作家从未尝试过的活力、情感，甚至暴力。 

## 关于《呼啸山庄》 

这本小说描述了一个扭曲的内心，追求死亡和复仇的故事，充满了病态、痛苦和暴力元素。在谈论恐怖的呼啸山庄后，瑟鲁瑟罗斯庄园的管家耐莉·迪恩生动地描绘了那里多事又不安的生活。作家通过巧妙的倒叙和时间转换，展示了一个充满情感、富有想象力的故事。 

呼啸山庄的前主人恩萧先生领养了一个名叫希斯克利夫的孤儿，将他视为自己的亲生孩子。恩萧先生去世后，希斯克利夫遭到儿子亨德雷的反复欺凌和侮辱。希斯克利夫选择离开，但却爱上了恩萧的女儿凯瑟琳。一天晚上，希斯克利夫偷听到凯瑟琳告诉耐莉自己不能嫁给他，因为这会贬低她，于是离开了高地。三年后，他返回时已经是富有的人，却发现凯瑟琳已嫁给了埃德加·林顿。希斯克利夫决定报仇，娶了埃德加的妹妹伊莎贝拉，并虐待她，以确保凯瑟琳的女儿凯茜能继承林顿的财产。在曲折的情节中，希斯克利夫展开了复仇计划，最终实现了自己的愿望。他梦想着与凯瑟琳在来世团聚，希望后代能够统一呼啸山庄和斯拉瑟罗斯庄园的两个家族。 

## 关于选段

以下情节选自小说第3章。小说呈现了两个梦境。第一个梦境充满激烈的气氛，语调诙谐但寓意深刻；第二个梦境则充满恐怖，揭示了《呼啸山庄》中所犯罪行。 

在第一个梦境中，洛克伍德先生做了一个梦，梦见自己与一位名叫杰贝斯·布兰德汉姆的牧师发生激烈争执，并最终演变为暴力对抗。虽然洛克伍德和布兰德汉姆都虔诚，但他们无法相互原谅，最终沦为暴力之道。这个梦境象征性地彰显了小说的主题：即使是虔诚的信徒，也可能隐藏着暴力的潜在因素，而仁慈和宽恕却很容易被遗忘。

在第二个梦境中，洛克伍德先生听到窗外树枝在风雪中发出刺耳的响声。他试图阻止这种噪音，却发现自己的手并未抓住树枝，而是被凯瑟琳·林顿的“一只冰冷的小手”紧紧抓住，她哭泣着乞求进入，“让我进去，让我进去！”接着紧随其后的是暴力和鲜血。洛克伍德惊醒，发现希斯克利夫冷漠地站在那里，手持蜡烛。这个事件为后续叙述者的故事创造了一个恐怖的背景，营造出一种幽灵般的氛围，让人联想起英国文学中的哥特式小说。
