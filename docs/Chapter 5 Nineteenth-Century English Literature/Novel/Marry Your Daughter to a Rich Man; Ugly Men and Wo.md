## About Jane Austen

Jane Austen (1775-1817) was the sixth child in a family of seven. Her father was a cultivated man who taught Jane and encouraged her to read and write. When she was still young and tender, she read widely. In 1783, Austen was sent to study at Oxford, but shortly, she was sent home because of illness. Austen was educated mainly at home afterwards. Her life is notable for its lack of events: she remained single and lived in the midst of an amiable family, with occasional visits to Bath and London. She was an avid letter writer, writing about 3,000 letters (less than 200 letters remain) that showcased her sharp wit and occasional coarseness. Such literary fondness and fluency led to her success as a novelist: During the early 1800s, when Jane Austen was composing and publishing her works, fictional novels were frowned upon by some segments of society, and novels written by women were especially sneered at. Many of Austen's works went to print with no name on the title page to avoid linking her to the stigma of female authorship.

Austen anonymously published Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), and Emma (1816). She wrote two other novels - Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818-and began another, eventually titled Sanditon, but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile, writings in manuscript, the short epistolary novel Lady Susan, and the unfinished novel The Watson.

Although anonymity and lack of recognition and fame characterized her life, Jane Austen's novels have since become celebrated, enjoyed, and studied for their humorous and pointed observations of societal life, lively character interaction, and detailed style. With plots often exploring the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security, these novels interpret, critique, and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the eighteenth century. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism and social commentary, has earned her acclaim among critics and scholars for the subsequent centuries.



简·奥斯汀（1775-1817年）是七兄弟姐妹中的第六个孩子。她的父亲是一个有教养的人，教导简读书写字。她幼时阅读广泛。1783年，奥斯汀被送去牛津学习，但不久以后因病被送回家。此后，奥斯汀主要在家受教育。她的一生因没有大事件而引人注目：她保持独身，在一个可爱的家庭中生活，偶尔去巴斯和伦敦探望。奥斯汀是一位热衷的书信作者，共写了约3000封信（现存不到200封），展示了她敏锐的智慧和偶尔的粗鲁。这种文学钟爱和流畅使她成为小说家的成功者：在19世纪初期，简·奥斯汀创作并出版作品时，小说在一些社会阶层中受到指责，女性写的小说尤其不受人待见。奥斯汀的许多作品都没有作者姓名出现在封面上，以避免将她与女性作者的污名联系起来。
 
奥斯汀匿名出版了《理智与情感》（1811年）、《傲慢与偏见》（1813年）、《曼斯菲尔德庄园》（1814年）和《爱玛》（1816年）。她还写了另外两部小说——《诺桑觉寺》和《劝导》，都是在1818年去世后遗作出版的，她还开始写了另一部小说，最终名为《桑顿》，但在完成前去世。她还留下了三卷少年时期的手稿作品、短篇书信体小说《莱迪·苏珊》和未完成的小说《华生》。 尽管匿名和缺乏认可和声誉是她一生的特点，但简·奥斯汀的小说自那时起就成为备受赞誉、喜爱和研究的对象，因为其中充满了幽默和尖锐的社会观察、生动的人物互动和细致的风格。情节经常探讨妇女对婚姻的依赖，以谋求有利的社会地位和经济保障，这些小说对18世纪末的英国乡绅进行了诠释、批判和评论。她使用尖刻的讽刺、现实主义和社会评论，赢得了评论家和学者们在接下来的几个世纪中的赞誉。
  
   
**关于《傲慢与偏见》和《劝导》**

《傲慢与偏见》讲述了伊丽莎白·班纳特和她的四个姐妹，她们必须嫁得好以确保财务安全。小说开始于富有的单身汉彬格莱先生和达西先生来到尼瑟菲尔德，引起班纳特姑娘们和她们的妈妈班纳特夫人的兴奋。在镇上举办的舞会上，伊丽莎白发现彬格莱先生是一个迷人又和蔼的绅士，而达西却冷漠和傲慢。达西拒绝并侮辱了出席者中的大多数女士，包括伊丽莎白，后者立即就不喜欢他。同时，有传言说达西的财富远比彬格莱的要大。在一次意外的相遇中，伊丽莎白被达西的举止和行为震惊并感到被冒犯，因为后者向她求婚。她立即拒绝了他。经过一些事件的曲折，达西给伊丽莎白写了一封解释他举止的信，她意识到自己严重误判了他的品格。达西拜访伊丽莎白，并再次问她是否愿意嫁给他，因为他爱她。这一次她接受了，因为她也爱上了他。起初，她的家人不相信她，毕竟她过去总是讨厌他，但一旦他们认识到伊丽莎白的感情是真实的，他们都接受了。小说最终以简和彬格莱先生以及伊丽莎白和达西先生的幸福婚姻结束。班纳特夫人也许是最快乐的：她为自己嫁掉了三个女儿感到成功。《傲慢与偏见》一直位列“最受喜爱的书籍”榜单的前列，成为英国文学中最受欢迎的小说之一。


《劝导》讲述了安妮·艾略特（Anne Elliot），一个27岁的英国女人，她的家人为了降低开支和减少债务将家租给了克罗夫特上将及其妻子。这位妻子的兄弟，弗雷德里克·温特沃斯船长，曾在安妮19岁时与她订婚，但由于安妮被她的教母拉塞尔夫人说服结束了他们的关系，这段订婚被取消。安妮的父亲沃尔特·艾略特爵士也认为这位年轻人的家庭配不上他自己，而且温特沃斯船长除了海军工资外没有其他经济支柱。 他们在八年分离后再次相遇。在他们分开期间，温特沃斯得到提升，成为海军中的富翁，正如他曾说过的那样。现在27岁的安妮并没有忘记她的爱。安妮仍然关心他，但他对她冷淡。然后安妮被她的表兄威廉·艾略特，一名鳏夫，追求。尽管安妮对艾略特不感兴趣，温特沃斯却对艾略特对安妮的兴趣感到嫉妒。温特沃斯给安妮写了一封长篇感情深挚的信。很快一切都在他们之间幸福地解决了，他们再次订婚。

这部小说在19世纪初受到欢迎，但它的更大声誉是随后在这个世纪及20世纪和21世纪继续下来。安妮·艾略特在奥斯丁小说中因其相对成熟而备受关注。由于《劝导》是奥斯丁的最后一部完成的作品，它被认为是她写作最成熟的小说，展现了一个逼近40岁的女性文学构思的精致之处。她在叙述中运用的自由间接话语方式已在1816年得到充分体现。 

**关于此文**

此文选第一个节选出自奥斯汀小说《傲慢与偏见》的开头场景。班纳特先生有五个女儿，但根据法律，他的财产只能传给男性继承人。因此，他的家庭在他去世后面临贫困的命运。因此，至少其中的一个女儿应该嫁给一个有钱人来养活其他人是一个推动情节的动机。在这个选择中，一个富有的单身汉查尔斯·彬格莱搬到了附近。 对此，班纳特夫人感到欣喜，立即密谋让他娶她五个女儿中的一个，这让她疏忽的丈夫感到很恼火。在这里的开头句和之后班纳特夫人和班纳特先生之间的对话中，读者可以感受到人物的现实刻画和奥斯汀小说中典型的讽刺。 

第二个节选出自《劝导》第十五章。沃尔特爵士将家人搬到巴斯的“卡姆登广场一座非常好的房子”里，安妮也加入了他们。晚上，她的父亲沃尔特爵士和她的妹妹主要是在谈论威廉·艾略特先生和他在马尔伯勒街区的朋友。在这里，奥斯汀在生动地描绘生活中的情况方面的才能得到了极好的展示。通过夸张和幽默感，她告诉读者沃尔特爵士和她的妹妹如何谈论艾略特先生、沃利斯夫妇的外表和性格；以及他们的谈话如何延伸到包括他们对巴斯街头男人和女人外貌的印象。简言之，读者可以感受到奥斯汀如何巧妙地运用英语语言在一个生活中如此普通的情境中实现简洁和准确，就像她自己说她的小说是“我用那样细腻的画笔在上面工作的一点点象牙”。

## About Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion

In this selection, two excerpts are presented from Jane Austen's novels. One is from Pride and Prejudice, and the other is from Persuasion.

Pride and Prejudice tells about Elizabeth Bennet and her four sisters, who must marry well to ensure their financial security. The novel begins when the wealthy bachelors Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy arrive in Netherfield, much to the excitement of the Bennet daughters and Mrs Bennet, their mother. At a ball held in the town, Elizabeth finds Mr Bingley a charming and affable gentleman, while Mr Darcy is cold and prideful. Darcy refuses and insults most of the women in attendance, including Elizabeth, who immediately dislikes him. Meanwhile, gossip has spread that Mr Darcy's wealth is much greater than Mr Bingley's. In an unexpected encounter, Elizabeth is shocked and offended by Mr Darcy's manners and behaviour when the latter proposes marriage to her. She immediately rejects him. After some complications of events, Darcy writes Elizabeth a letter explaining his behaviour, and she comes to realize she has severely misjudged his character. Darcy pays a visit to Elizabeth and asks her again if she will marry him because he loves her. This time she accepts because she has growin to love him, too. At first, her family doesn't believe her-she had always hated him, after all but they come around once they recognize the truth of Elizabeth's feelings. The novel ends with the happy marriages of Jane and Mr Bingley, and Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. Mrs Bennet is perhaps the happiest of all: she feels accomplished for having married off three of her daughters. Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of "most-loved books" among literary scholars and the reading public, becoming one of the most popular novels in English literature.

Persuasion tells about Anne Elliot, a 27-year-old Englishwoman whose family moves to lower their expenses and reduce their debt by renting their home to Admiral Croft and his wife. The wife's brother, Captain Frederick Wentworth, was engaged to Anne when she was nineteen, but the engagement was broken when Anne was persuaded by her godmother Lady Russel to end their relationship. Sir Walter Elliot, Anne's father, also felt that the young man's family was not good enough for his own, and Captain Wentworth had no financial means beyond his navy pay.

They meet again after an eight-year separation. During their separation, Wentworth had been promoted and became rich in the navy, just as he had said he would. Anne, now twenty-seven years old, has not forgotten her love. Anne still cares for him, but he is aloof to her. Then Anne is courted by her cousin, Mr William Elliot, a widower. Though Anne is not interested in Elliot, Wentworth is jealous of Elliot's interest in Anne. Wentworth writes Anne a long, emotional letter pouring out his heart to her. Soon all' is settled happily between them, and they have engaged again. The novel was well-received in the early nineteenth century, but its greater fame came later in this century and continued into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Anne Elliot is noteworthy among Austen's heroines for her relative maturity. As Persuasion was Austen's last completed work, it is accepted as her most maturely written novel, showing a refinement of literary conception indicative of a woman approaching 40 years of age. Her use of free indirect speech in the narrative was fully evidenced by 1816.

## About This Selection

The first excerpt in this selection is from the beginning scenes of Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice. Mr Bennet has five daughters, but by law, his property can only be passed to a male heir. So his family faces becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the daughters should marry a wealthy man to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot. In this selection, a rich bachelor Mr Charles Bingley moves into the neighbourhood.

Overjoyed, Mrs Bennet immediately plots to get him to marry one of her five daughters, much to the annoyance of her inattentive husband. Here in the opening sentence and the dialogue that follows between Mrs and Mr Bennet, the reader may feel the realistic portrayal of the character and the irony typical of Austen's novels.

The second excerpt is from Chapter XV. of Persuasion. Sir Walter Elliot has moved his family into a "very good house in Camden Place" in Bath: Anne has joined them. In the evening, her father, Sir Walter, and her sister mostly talk about Mr William Elliot and his friends in Marlborough Buildings. Here Austen's talent in portraying a situation in life in detail is superbly demonstrated. With exaggeration and a sense of humour, she tells the reader how Sir Walter and her sister talk of the look and character of Mr Elliot, Mr and Mrs Wallis; and how their talk extends to include their impression of the look of men and women in the streets of Bath. In a nutshell, the reader may feel how masterly Austen uses the English language to achieve conciseness and precision in a situation so ordinary in life, much as she has said of herself that her novel is "a little bit of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush."
