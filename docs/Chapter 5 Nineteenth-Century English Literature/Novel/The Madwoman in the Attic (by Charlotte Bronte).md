## About Charlotte Bronte

Charlotte Bronte (1816-1855) was the third daughter of the family. In 1820, the Bronte family moved to Haworth, and then Charlotte's life was marked by the untimely death of her family members and her career mobility. The mother died in 1821. Soon the two eldest daughters died of illness. The father made Charlotte and her sisters pursue their education at home. They read widely and became literarily imaginative, In 1831 Charlotte went to study at a boarding school at Roe Head, where she became an assistant teacher in 1835. Three years later, Charlotte left Roe Head School. In 1839 she accepted a position as governess but left after three months. In 1841 she became a governess in the White family, but left, once again, after nine months. In the following year, Charlotte and her sister Emily went to Brussels for further studies. After a trip home to Haworth, Charlotte returned alone to Brussels, where she remained until 1844. The Brontes sisters published their Poems in 1846 under pseudonyms. Charlotte also wrote The Professor, but was rejected for publication. One year later, however, Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Anne's Agnes Grey were all published, still under pseudonyms. In 1849 Charlotte, visiting London, began to move in literary circles, meeting writers and attending lectures. And in 1853, she published her final novel Villette based on her memories of Brussels. In 1854 Charlott married Nicholls, a curate in Haworth, much against her father's will. Unfortunately, she caught pneumonia while expecting a child, and after a lengthy and painful illness, she died in 1855. 1857 saw the posthumous publication of The Professor, and in that same year, Mrs Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Bronte was published.

## About Jane Eyre

Jane Eyre, an orphan, lives with her aunt Mrs Reed and three cousins. Mrs Reed grows impatient with Jane and sends her away to a boarding school. The conditions at the school are harsh. Mr Brocklehurst, the supervisor, is cruel and hypocritical, foreing the students to live in miserable conditions. Jane is devastated when her friend Helen dies during a typhus outbreak at the school.
Jane stays at the school for six more years as a student and two years as a teacher before becoming a governess at Thornfield Hall. Mr Rochester, the owner of Thornfield, catches Jane's attention. She finds herself intrigued by his peculiar personality and blunt honesty. Likewise, Mr Rochester loves Jane's forthright nature and strong convictions. Nevertheless, Mr Rochester begins to court another woman, upsetting Jane, who finds herself in love with him. Then, Jane is shocked when Mr Rochester proposes to her. Jane joyfully accepts his proposal, but their wedding is interrupted when a man objects, announcing that Mr Rochester is already married. Mr Rochester confesses this and then shows Jane his wife, Bertha, who is mad and confined in an attic. Jane flees Thornfield. She wanders in the heath until she is nearly starving. A clergyman named St. John Rivers and his two sisters saved Jane. St. John proposes to Jane; but Jane refuses, knowing he does not love her.

She is told that Bertha Rochester set the Hall on fire and leapt from the roof to her death. Mr Rochester loses his hand and his eyesight in the fire. On the ashes of the burnt Thornfield, Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester reunite and get married. Mr Rochester later regains some of his sight, and the couple have a son.

## About This Selection

The following selection is composed of two episodes from Jane Eyre. One from Chapter 11, and the other from Chapter 26. In the first, Jane Eyre arrives at Thornfield as a governess. She is received by Mrs Fairfax, the housekeeper, who shows her around the Hall. Mrs Fairfax suggests that they ascend the ladder to the top of the Hall and "see the view from thence". It is there that Jane first hears a loud and echoing laugh, "distinct, formal, mirthless". Mrs Fairfax explains that it must be the laugh of some servant. 

In the second excerpt, the ready wedding of Mr Rochester and Jane Eyre is disrupted by Mr Mason, who claims that Mr Rochester has already married. The disappointed Mr Rochester shows Jane Eyre where his violently lunatic wife is. He takes Jane and Mason to the attic, where Jane heard the tragic laugh when she first arrived at Thornfield. The laugh was from Bertha Mason, Mr Rochester's insane first wife. Jane is shocked, and after a long conversation with Mr Rochester, she decides to leave him. This scene in the novel has inspired feminist critics in the twentieth century. Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar wrote a 1979 book entitled The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination, a classic of feminist literary criticism.

以下选择由《简·爱》中的两个片段组成。一个来自第11章，另一个来自第26章。在第一个片段中，简·爱作为家庭教师抵达索菲尔德。她受到了管家费尔法太太的接待，后者带她参观了庄园。费尔法太太建议他们爬楼梯到庄园顶端，“从那里看风景”。简第一次在那里听到一个响亮而回荡的笑声，“清晰、呆板、没有欢乐”。费尔法太太解释说那一定是某个仆人的笑声。

在第二段中，罗切斯特先生和简·爱即将举行的婚礼被声称罗切斯特先生已经结婚的梅森先生打断。失望的罗切斯特先生带简·爱去见他暴躁疯狂的妻子。他带着简和梅森去了阁楼，在那里简第一次抵达索菲尔德时听到了悲凄的笑声。那个笑声来自贝莎·梅森，罗切斯特先生疯狂的第一位妻子。简感到震惊，在与罗切斯特先生长时间对话后，她决定离开他。这个小说场景激发了20世纪女权主义评论家的灵感。桑德拉·吉尔伯特和苏珊·古巴尔于1979年共同撰写了一本名为《阁楼里的疯女人：女作家与19世纪文学想象力》的书，这是女性主义文学评论的经典之作。
