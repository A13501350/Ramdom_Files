## About Charles Dickens
Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was the second of eight children to a clerk in the navy pay office. At twelve, he had to leave school to work in a boot-blacking warehouse when his father was imprisoned for not being able to pay his debt. He then worked as an office boy, and studied shorthand. Dickens began his literary career as a journalist and grew to be a prolific novelist and a social reformer. He wrote fifteen novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles. Most of Dickens's works were originally written for serial publication. To keep up with the demand, he has to write constantly. Some critics scorn his work as popular melodramas catering to the tastes of the labouring masses. Despite this critical bias, the readers find Dickens a masterful storyteller and a genius at characterization. Dickens drew his inspiration mostly from three sources. First, much of his writing is autobiographical. One can see the deserted, poverty-stricken child in Oliver Twist (1837-1838), the aspiring young writer in David Copperfield
(1849-1850), the memory of his godfather Huffam as Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dombey and Son (1846-1848), and the misguided young man in Pip, the protagonist of Great Expectations (1860-1861). Dickens wrote about the many social problems of Victorian society. Bleak House (1852-1853) showcases Dickens's knowledge about the complexities of the law courts, just as Martin Chuzzlewit (1843-1844) does as a satiric overview of Victorian social absurdities. In Hard Times (1854), Dickens focused on the deficiencies of the Utilitarian philosophy of the period, and in Little Dorrit (1855-1857), he turned his attention to the bureaucracy of the business world. Finally, Dickens's novels are also developed from many conventions of fiction itself. Dickens is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian Age. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime; by the twentieth century, critics and scholars had recognized him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are still widely read today.

关于查尔斯·狄更斯： 查尔斯·狄更斯（1812-1870）出生于众多兄弟姐妹中排行老二，他在12岁时父亲因负债而坐牢，这迫使他离开学校到鞋油仓库工作。之后，他成为一名办公室文员，学会了速记。狄更斯的文学之路始于成为记者，后来成为一名极富成就的小说家和社会改革者。他创作了15部长篇小说、5部中篇小说、数百篇短篇小说和散文作品。狄更斯的大部分作品最初都是为分期连载而写的，为满足需求不断创作。尽管有些评论家蔑视他的作品，认为是平庸的通俗小说，但读者仍然认为狄更斯是一位出色的讲故事者和人物创作者。

狄更斯的灵感主要来自三个方面。首先，他的很多作品都有自传元素，比如《雾都孤儿》（1837-1838）、《大卫·科波菲尔》（1849-1850）、《董贝父子》（1846-1848）和《远大前程》（1860-1861）。狄更斯揭示了维多利亚时代社会的众多问题，如《荒凉山庄》（1852-1853）反映了他对法庭体系的深刻理解，《马丁·朱述伟》（1843-1844）则讽刺了维多利亚时代的荒谬现象。在《艰难时世》（1854年）中，他批评了功利主义哲学，而《小杜丽》（1855-1857年）则关注商业官僚主义。最后，狄更斯的小说也受到了许多传统的影响。人们普遍认为他是维多利亚时代最伟大的小说家之一，他的作品在其生前备受欢迎，到了20世纪，评论家和学者们已经承认他是一位文学天才。至今，他的小说和短篇小说仍广泛传播。

## About Dombey and Son and Oliver Twist

This selection includes one excerpt from Dickens's Dombey and Son, and another from Oliver Twist.

Mr Dombey is a stiff, dignified man who rarely shows emotion, but the birth of his infant son, named Paul, gives him great delight. The son would inherit his firm of Dombey and Son. Mrs Dombey dies shortly after the boy's birth. So the father's attention centres entirely on the little infant while his daughter, Florence, is neglected, for she cannot take a place in his business. Mr Dombey's second wife, Edith, does not love him and eventually runs away with Carker, a manager at the firm. With Carker gone, Mr Dombey is incapable of managing the business, and the firm fails. In the end, Mr Dombey is reconciled with his daughter, living with her family and doting on his grandchildren. Mingled with this central storyline is the story of Walter Gay and his uncle Solomon Gills, owner of a nautical instruments shop. Walter goes to work for the firm of Dombey and Son. One day, Florence goes with her maid and Polly, the nurse of little Paul, to Camden Town, northwest of London. She gets lost in the streets and misled by Good Mrs Brown, who robs Florence of her clothes. Walter rescues the miserable girl, and the two become friends, which causes Mr Dombey to feel uneasy as he dislikes his daughter. To get rid of Walter, Dombey sends him to Barbados on business. Then misfortune strikes. Walter's ship is wrecked and he is presumed dead. In grief, Solomon Gills goes in search of Walter. It turns out that Walter has survived the shipwreck and returned home. Overjoyed, the boy and the girl reunite for marriage. On the eve of their wedding, Solomon Gills returns home. After the wedding, Florence is reconciled with her father. The novel ends on a happy note.

Oliver Twist tells the story of a poor boy named Oliver Twist, born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, Agnes, dies shortly after his birth. Oliver lives at a "child farm" (orphanage) and then is transferred to a workhouse. Oliver is threatened by other boys at the workhouse, and they demand that he ask for more gruel at the meal. After suffering repeated bullies and insults, Oliver runs away and comes to London, where he falls into the hands of Fagin, a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Oliver is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. He is caught but saved from a legal conviction by Mr Brownlow, who takes the feverish Oliver to his home and nurses him back to health.

## About This Selection

The first excerpt from Dombey and Son describes a visit to Staggs's Gardens in Camden Town of London by Polly, a nursemaid for the Dombey family, along with little Paul, Florence, and Susan (Florence's maid). One thing that stands out in this selection is Dickens's recollection of the chaotic destructions and desolation of the town caused by the earthquake. Readers will be very much impressed by Dickens's amazing aptitude for visualizing scenes in concrete detail and his power to depict such a vision in words. They will also realize in part what gigantic changes had taken place in Dickens's time. In fact, one theme of this novel is the destruction and degradation of both people and places caused by industrialization, illustrated especially by the construction of the new railway through Camden Town. The novel somehow reflects Dickens's concerns with railway travel and the general ambivalence towards the effects of the railways-they generated prosperity and jobs but undermined older ways of living to make way for capitalist expansion.

The latter excerpt focuses on a famous scene in Oliver Twist. It shows how the gnawing hunger in a Victorian workhouse compels the boys to intimidate a weakly boy, forcing him to brave the authority and utter the famous phrase, "Please, sir, I want some more." Dickens, in a detached but lightly sarcastic tone, exposes the hypocrisy of those upper-class gentlemen who believe, in Dickens's words, that the workhouse is "a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work."

多姆比先生是一个刻板、端庄的男人，很少流露情感，但他的婴儿儿子保罗的诞生给了他极大的快乐。这个儿子将继承他的公司“多姆比父子公司”。多姆比夫人在男孩出生后不久就去世了。所以父亲的注意力完全集中在这个小婴儿身上，而他的女儿弗洛伦斯则被忽视了，因为她无法在他的生意中占据一席之地。多姆比的第二任妻子伊迪丝并不爱他，最终和公司的经理卡克尔私奔了。随着卡克尔的离去，多姆比无法管理企业，公司倒闭了。最后，多姆比和女儿和解，和她一家人生活在一起，宠爱着他的孙辈。在这个中心故事线中交织着沃尔特·盖和他的叔叔所罗门·吉尔斯的故事，后者是一家导航仪器店的老板。沃尔特去多姆比父子公司工作。一天，弗洛伦斯和她的女仆以及小保罗的保姆波莉一起去了伦敦西北部的坎登镇。她在街上迷路了，被诱导并被好太太布朗偷走了衣服。沃尔特救起了这个可怜的女孩，二人成为朋友，这让多姆比感到不安，因为他不喜欢自己的女儿。为了摆脱沃尔特，多姆比派他去巴巴多斯出差。然后不幸降临。沃尔特的船在海难中沉没，人们都以为他已经死了。在悲痛中，所罗门·吉尔斯踏上寻找沃尔特的旅途。结果沃尔特幸存下来，回到家中。男孩和女孩欢喜团聚并结婚。在他们婚礼前夕，所罗门·吉尔斯回家了。婚礼之后，弗洛伦斯和她的父亲和解。小说以幸福的结局结束。 

《雾都孤儿》讲述了一个名叫奥利弗·特威斯特的贫穷男孩的故事，他出生于19世纪30年代的英格兰的一家救济院。他的母亲阿格尼丝在他出生后不久就去世了。奥利弗在一个“儿童农场”（孤儿院）生活，然后被转移到一家救济院。奥利弗受到救济院其他男孩的威胁，并要求他在用餐时要求更多的稀粥。在多次遭受欺凌和侮辱后，奥利弗逃跑来到伦敦，在那里被犯罪生涯的费金控制，费金训练孤儿男孩为他行窃。接受了几天的训练后，奥利弗被派去和另外两个男孩进行扒窃任务。他被抓住，但被布朗洛先生救赎，后者将发烧的奥利弗带回家，并将他照顾好。与此同时，费金帮中的两名年轻成员——比尔·赛克斯和他的情人南希——抓住奥利弗并将他带回费金那里，费金再次派遣奥利弗执行盗窃任务；这一次，他被梅莉太太和她的侄女罗丝所救。奥利弗与他们一起在乡间度过了一个宁静的夏天。但费金和一个叫蒙克斯的神秘人都在想方设法抓住奥利弗。与此同时，揭露了奥利弗的母亲过世时留下的一枚金锁链。蒙克斯拿到并毁掉了那块锁链，以掩盖奥利弗的真实身份，防止他继承自己应有的财产。当梅莉家人来到伦敦时，南希私下会见罗丝并告诉她费金的邪恶计划，但费金手下的一名成员偷听到了谈话并向赛克斯报告。赛克斯愤怒之下残忍地谋杀了南希，逃离伦敦，最终趁逃跑时上吊自尽。最终揭示，蒙克斯是奥利弗的同父异母兄弟，罗丝是阿格尼丝的妹妹，也就是奥利弗的姨妈。邪恶受到惩罚，善良受到奖赏。费金被绞死，布朗洛先生收养了奥利弗，并和梅莉一家退隐乡间过着幸福的生活。


第一段节选描述了护士庖莉（唐贝家的保姆），携带小保罗、弗洛伦斯和苏珊（弗洛伦斯的侍女），访问伦敦卡姆登镇的斯塔格斯花园。引人注目的一点是狄更斯对地震所造成的城镇的混乱破坏和荒凉的回忆。读者们会被狄更斯惊人的具象化场景的能力以及他用文字描绘这一景象的力量所深深打动。他们也会在一定程度上意识到在狄更斯时代发生的巨大变化。事实上，这部小说的一个主题是工业化所导致的人和地方的毁灭和贬低，特别是通过卡姆登镇修建新铁路的方式所体现。这部小说在某种程度上反映了狄更斯对铁路旅行以及普遍对铁路影响的矛盾态度——铁路带来了繁荣和就业机会，但也为资本主义扩张让位而破坏了较老的生活方式。 

后一段节选集中讨论了《雾都孤儿》中一个著名场景。它展示了维多利亚时代收容所中的饥饿如灼的困境迫使男孩们恐吓一个虚弱的男孩，迫使他勇敢面对权威并说出那句著名的话：“先生，请给我点更多。”狄更斯以超然但轻微讽刺的语调，揭露了那些上流社会绅士的虚伪，他们认为收容所是“穷人的定期公共娱乐场所；一家没有付款的酒馆；全年供应早餐、午餐、茶点和晚餐的公共场所；一个瓦砖堆砌的乐园，那里只有玩乐没有工作”。
