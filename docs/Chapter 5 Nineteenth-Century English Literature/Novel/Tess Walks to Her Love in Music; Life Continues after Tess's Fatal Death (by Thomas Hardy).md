## About Thomas Hardy

Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) was the son of a stonemason. His mother, "a born bookworm", encouraged him to read widely. At sixteen, young Hardy was apprenticed to a local architect. In 1866, Hardy began writing poetry. The next year, he wrote his first novel, The Poor Man and the Lady. Encouraged by his readers, he wrote a pastoral idyll entitled Under the Greenwood Tree
(1872). With this book, Hardy had found his true subject the rural English life of an imaginary area he called Wessex. He quit his job and devoted his time to writing novels. In 1874, his first great novel, Far from the Madding Crowd, was published. Four years later, his next great novel, The Return of the Native (1878), appeared, followed by the third, The Mayor of Casterbridge
(1886). By then, Hardy was known to be a philosophical novelist. His "philosophy" was summed up by his phrase in his notebooks: "The world does not despise us; it only neglects us." Indeed, nearly all of Hardy's writings express his loss of faith and the quest for a new value system.
Hardy's other two masterpieces are Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891) and Jude the Obscure (1895).
They deal respectively with the so-called marriage question in England and the problem of equal education. Up from the plots looms a strong sense of fatalism: the world is an indifferent place, meaningless and valueless. One thing must be noted: the publication of Tess brought some unfavourable criticism to Hardy, which increased in intensity after the publication of Jude the Obscure. Some critics are unhappy with Hardy's novels for their iconoclastic views of sexuality, marriage, and class distinctions. Nonetheless, Thomas Hardy is considered second only to Charles Dickens as the most-read and most-discussed writer of the Victorian era. Considering his career that extends from the Victorian era to World War I and his inventive writing technique that blends the old-fashioned and the modern, Hardy is a distinetly modern novelist. As one critic has said, he not only directs readers' attention back to the trauma of the loss of faith in the nineteenth century, but also leads them into the quest for the renewed value that characterizes the modern era. Hardy is also a prolific poet. He published more than a thousand poems.

## About Tess of the D'Urbervilles

Tess is a pretty daughter of a poor villager who accidentally learns that he is descended from a noble family named d'Urberville. Tess's beauty attracts Alec Stoke-d' Urberville, who offers her a job. Alec chases Tess for love and finds a chance to rape her in the woods. Tess gives birth, but the infant soon dies.Some time later, Tess meets Angel Clare, a young man, polite and intellectual. Clare falls in love with Tess, who is reluctant, but eventually accepts the marriage and tries unsuccessfully to reveal her past before the wedding. Tess tells Clare about her past the night after their wedding, but he is too shocked to forgive. Clare deserts Tess. After some hardship, Tess decides to visit Angel's parents. On her way back, Tess hears an itinerant preacher who turns out to be Alec. When he sees Tess, Alec's lust is reawakened. He once more chases Tess, offering her and her family money, reminding her that Clare is not acting as her husband.
Out of sheer poverty, Tess has to stay with Alec. In the meantime, the repentant Clare returns from Brazil to seek his wife. But he arrives too late. It soon happens that Tess, to free herself, has stabbed Alec and is being pursued by the police. Tess and Clare run away, and they stop for the night at Stonehenge. At daybreak, the police arrive and take Tess away. Tess is tried and hanged.
At the end of the novel, Clare and Tess's younger sister, hand in hand, leave the city in grief as well as in hope.

## About This Selection

Here are two excerpts from Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles. The first one is from Chapter 19, telling how Tess, like a little bird, is fascinated by the sweet music coming out of an attic above a garden. It is Angel Clare who is playing a second-hand harp. Tess walks across the garden, towards the attic. She tries to hurry away unnoticed when Clare sees her and speaks to her.

Notice in this excerpt how Hardy's masterful description of the air, the music, and the things in the garden echoes Tess's innocence and the complexity of her feelings. In the second episode, Angel Clare and Eliza Louisa (Liza-Lu) are leaving the city. At the top of a green hill, they stop when they hear the knell announcing the execution of Tess, and bend down to the earth for a long time. 

Hardy concludes the novel with these words, " ...the President of the Immortals, in Eschylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.... As soon as they (Clare and 'Liza-Lu) had strength, they arose, joined hands again, and went on." Hardy has thus presented a powerful symbol that permeates his novels: life will continue with a spark of hope in the darkness of fatalism.

## 关于托马斯·哈代

托马斯·哈代 (1840-1928) 出身自石匠之家。他的母亲是一位饱读诗书的知识分子, 鼓励他广泛地涉猎文学著作。年方16的哈代在当地一位建筑师门下担任学徒。1866 年, 哈代开始涉足诗歌创作。次年, 他著有了处女作《穷人与贵妇》。在读者的鼓励下, 他创作出了名为《绿林树下》的田园诗作 (1872 年)。通过这部作品, 哈代找到了他真正的创作主题——威塞克斯, 一个幻想的英国乡村地区的生活。他告别了业务工作, 全身心地沉浸在小说写作中。1874 年, 他的首部伟大小说《远离尘嚣》面世。四年后, 他的又一伟大作品《还乡》(1878 年) 问世, 紧接着的是第三部《卡斯特桥市长》 (1886 年)。此时, 哈代已为人所知, 成为一位深思熟虑的小说家。

通过他在笔记本中的一句话，哈代的“哲学”可以被概括为：“世界并不鄙视我们；它只是忽略了我们。” 事实上, 几乎他所有的作品都表达了对失去信仰寻求新价值体系的渴望。哈代的另外两部杰作是《德伯家的苔丝》 (1891 年) 和《无名的裘德》 (1895 年)。分别探讨英国的婚姻和平等教育的问题。情节中透露出深深的宿命论: 世界是一个冷漠的地方, 毫无意义也毫无价值。需要注意的是, 《苔丝》的出版给哈代带来了一些不利的批评, 在《无名的裘德》问世后, 这种批评更加猛烈。有些评论家因他们对性、婚姻和阶级差异持反传统观点而不满哈代的小说。不过, 托马斯·哈代被认为是维多利亚时代最多讨论的作家, 仅次于查尔斯·狄更斯。而他的创作生涯自维多利亚时代直至第一次世界大战, 并且他融合了传统和现代的创造性写作技巧, 成为典型的现代小说家。就如一位评论家所言, 他不仅让读者回顾 19 世纪信仰丧失的创伤, 也带领他们去探索现代时代的新价值观。哈代也是一位多产的诗人, 共出版了一千多首诗。

## 关于此选集 

以下是取自《德伯家的苔丝》中的两段节录。第一段摘录自第19章, 描述了苔丝如何被花园阁楼传出的美妙音乐所吸引, 就像一只小鸟一样。那是安吉尔·克莱尔在弹奏一把二手竖琴。苔丝穿过花园, 朝阁楼走去。当克莱尔看到她并与她说话时, 她试图不被人发现地匆匆离开。 请留意, 在此节录中, 哈代对空气、音乐和花园事物的精妙描绘和苔丝的纯真以及她复杂的感情形成了和谐共鸣。

在第二节录中, 安吉尔·克莱尔和伊丽莎·路易莎(丽莎·露) 离开这座城市。在一座绿色山顶上, 当她们听到宣告处决苔丝的丧钟声时, 她们停了下来, 弯下腰, 长时间地驻足。 哈代以这些文字结束了小说：“……用埃斯库罗斯的言辞来说, 不朽的斗士结束了他与苔丝的对决……她们(克莱尔和丽莎·露) 劝有了力气, 就站了起来, 再次携手前进。” 哈代以此透露出贯穿其小说的强烈象征: 在宿命的黑暗中, 生活将持有一丝希望, 继续前行。
