（1）尊者比德（Venerable Bede）的主要生平事迹及其代表作：
比德，又称圣比德，生活在公元672/673年至735年间，是盎格鲁-撒克逊时期的一位杰出历史学家和学者。幼年时师从修道院长比斯克普，在位于英格兰东北部贾罗的修道院度过了大半生。他不仅精通拉丁文和希腊文，还撰写了近40部涵盖多种学科的著作，其中最为著名的包括《英吉利教会史》（Ecclesiastical History of the English People）、《论事物本质》（De Natura Rerum）以及《修道院长列传》（Lives of the Abbots）。由于他在记录基督教在英格兰发展史上的贡献，被尊称为“英国历史之父”。

（2）卡德蒙的身份和修道院的名称：
卡德蒙（Cædmon）是公元7世纪的盎格鲁-撒克逊基督教诗人，被传统认为是首位留下诗歌作品的英语诗人。据比德记载，卡德蒙原本是一个不识字的牧人，在靠近惠特比修道院的一个修道院属地上工作。他的唯一存世作品是《卡德蒙的赞美诗》（Cædmon's Hymn），这是一首用古英语写成的九行头韵白话诗，早于约公元9世纪编写的史诗《贝奥武甫》。

（3）《亚瑟王之死》（Le Morte D'Arthur）的大致创作年代：
《亚瑟王之死》由英国作家托马斯·马洛礼撰写，完成于1485年，讲述了亚瑟王及其圆桌骑士的传奇故事，其中包括他们的兴衰历程以及对圣杯的追求。马洛礼可能在1450年后因犯罪指控而在监狱中创作了这部作品，部分内容源自法国书籍。

（4）马洛礼的文学史地位：
尽管马洛礼的真实身份存在争议，但他仍被视为早期英语文学中颇具影响力的作者，《亚瑟王之死》被认为是第一部用英文编写，全面叙述亚瑟王及其圆桌骑士团建立与瓦解的散文作品。他的叙事风格强调骑士之间的兄弟情谊而非宫廷爱情，关注忠诚冲突如何最终导致骑士团的破裂。

领会要点：
（1）选篇1中的梦幻寓意：Cædmon的梦境描绘了一种神圣启示和天赋降临的情景，通过这一梦境，Cædmon获得了赞美上帝创造世界的能力，体现了信仰与创造力之间的神秘联系。

（2）选篇3中亚瑟王弃神剑的象征意义：在《亚瑟王之死》中，亚瑟王命令将他的王者之剑投入湖中，这一行为象征着他的统治即将终结，同时也预示着亚瑟王传说并未随着他的死亡而消亡，而是作为一种精神和理想继续流传下去。

（3）选篇3简洁的叙事散文风格：马洛礼在《亚瑟王之死》中的叙事方式直接、有力且富有节奏感，通过“and”等连接词和连续动作的描写，生动展现了故事的关键转折时刻。

(1) The allegorical significance within Excerpt 1: Cædmon's visionary encounter illustrates a moment of divine inspiration and the emergence of artistic prowess. This revelatory dream bestows upon Cædmon the capacity to extol the glory of God for His creation of the universe, highlighting the enigmatic interplay between faith and ingenuity.

(2) The emblematic connotation of King Arthur's relinquishment of Excalibur in Excerpt 3: Within The Morte d'Arthur, King Arthur commands for his legendary sword to be cast into the lake. This symbolic gesture signifies the closure of his sovereignty and also portends that the legacy of King Arthur will endure beyond his demise, perpetuating as a spiritual essence and paragon.

(3) The succinct narrative style in Excerpt 3: Malory's prose in The Morte d'Arthur manifests as explicit, commanding, and cadenced. By incorporating conjunctions like "and" and delineating continuous sequences of events, crucial junctures in the narrative unfold vividly.

应用实例：
（1）cathedral, monastery, church, abbey各词的异同：
- Cathedral（大教堂）通常指天主教或某些基督教派别主教座堂，是教区的精神中心和主要礼拜场所；
- Monastery（修道院）是僧侣或修女集体生活的场所，专注于祈祷、冥想和修行，有时附设有教堂；
- Church（教堂）泛指基督教徒做礼拜的场所，包括各类大小不等的教堂，属于一般意义上的宗教活动空间；
- Abbey（修道院教堂）既可以指代整个修道院，也可以专指修道院内的教堂，如惠特比修道院（Whitby Abbey）即包含了一个教堂。

（2）应用连接词“and”和不同动词进行叙事，例如：After leaving the drinking hall, Cædmon walked towards the animal shed, and upon reaching his destination, he tended to the livestock and then, feeling tired, laid down to rest, and eventually fell asleep, and in that sleep, he encountered the divine vision.

（3）简略归纳或评述本节选文：
本节选文展示了两位重要的英国文学先驱人物，分别是通过作品传承了早期基督教文化与诗歌传统的卡德蒙，以及以《亚瑟王之死》丰富和发展了英国中世纪传奇文学的马洛礼。比德的记载揭示了卡德蒙奇迹般获得诗歌创作才能的过程，彰显了信仰与才智之间的奇妙融合；而马洛礼则以其独特的叙事方式塑造了亚瑟王传奇故事的结局，通过亚瑟王放弃神剑的场景，传达了权力更迭与永恒传奇的主题。

#### （二）诗歌：熟读本节内容，研习本节选诗及相关内容。
1. 识记：（1）乔叟和斯凯尔顿的主要生平事迹和代表作；（2）乔叟的《坎特伯雷故事集》的创作年代及对英语文学的贡献；（3）“斯凯尔顿诗体”的特点。
2. 领会：（1）读懂本节所列选诗，理解其主题；（2）选篇1中自然意象的审美作用和现实意义；（3）选篇2中重复句式表达情感的功能。
3. 应用：（1）根据选篇1大致归纳中古英语和现代英语的差别；（2）比较分析选篇1和选篇2的诗体不同。

（1）乔叟和斯凯尔顿的主要生平事迹和代表作：
乔叟（Geoffrey Chaucer）生于约1343年，逝世于1400年，是中世纪英国最重要的诗人之一，被誉为“英国诗歌之父”。他的主要作品是《坎特伯雷故事集》（The Canterbury Tales），这部诗体小说集创作于1387年至1400年间，以中世纪英语写成，通过一系列故事反映了当时社会生活的多个层面，尤其体现了人文主义倾向，对英国乃至欧洲的文学发展产生了深远的影响。

斯凯尔顿（John Skelton）生活在约1464年至1529年之间，是诗人、剧作家和讽刺作家。他的作品如《宫廷的陋室》（The Bowge of Courte）讽刺了亨利七世的宫廷生活，《月桂花环》（A Garland of Laurel）则展示了他的自我赞美，而《伊利诺尔鲁明之歌》（The Tunnyng of Elynour Rummyng）则是他最具活力的作品。斯凯尔顿独创的“斯凯尔顿体”诗歌因其不规则的节奏和韵律而独具特色，例如《致玛格丽特·赫西夫人》（To Mistress Margaret Hussey）就是“斯凯尔顿体”的典型代表。


Geoffrey Chaucer, born around 1343 and passing away in 1400, is recognized as a prominent figure in medieval English poetry, often referred to as the "Father of English Poetry". Notably, his significant literary contribution lies in his magnum opus, The Canterbury Tales, crafted between 1387 and 1400 in medieval English. Through an assortment of tales, this collection captures various facets of social life of that epoch, particularly encapsulating humanistic inclinations, thus exerting a profound influence on the evolution of British and European literature.

John Skelton, spanning the years 1464 to 1529, established his reputation as a poet, playwright, and satirist. His oeuvre, including works such as The Bowge of Courte, which satirizes the courtly milieu of Henry VII, A Garland of Laurel showcasing his self-adulation, and The Tunnyng of Elynour Rummyng, stand out as distinctive creations within his repertoire. Skelton's pioneering "Skelton verse" poetry is renowned for its irregular metrical structure and rhyme scheme, with pieces like "To Mistress Margaret Hussey" serving as prime illustrations of this stylistic convention.

（2）乔叟的《坎特伯雷故事集》的创作年代及对英语文学的贡献：
《坎特伯雷故事集》创作于14世纪末期，它不仅是乔叟最知名的作品，而且对英语文学有着里程碑式的意义。乔叟选择使用中世纪英语书写，而非当时主流的拉丁语或法语，这标志着他致力于推动英语成为文学创作的载体，从而在文学史上起到了关键性的变革作用。该作品以其多元化的主题、鲜活的人物形象和口语化风格，为英国文艺复兴时期的人文主义文学奠定了基础。


The inception of Chaucer's epic creation, "The Canterbury Tales," during the late 14th century, not only stands as Chaucer's crowning achievement but also signifies a seminal moment in the annals of English literature. Opting to compose his work in medieval English as opposed to the prevalent Latin or French of the era underscored Chaucer's advocacy for English as a medium of literary expression, consequently playing a pivotal role in the narrative of literary development. Rich in thematic diversity, vibrant characterizations, and colloquialism, this monumental work laid the groundwork for humanistic literature during the British Renaissance.

（3）“斯凯尔顿诗体”的特点：
“斯凯尔顿诗体”以不规则的节奏和长度各异的诗行构成，但保持固定的韵律。每一行的音节数量和重音位置变动较大，通常较短，包含2至3个重音，有时更多。它摒弃交叉韵，一韵到底，并频繁运用排比句作为修辞手法。斯凯尔顿本人形容其诗体为“破烂、不整、粗犷”，但却因其独特性而深受喜爱。

The hallmark of "Skelton form" resides in its irregular meters and fluctuating line lengths while adhering to a consistent rhythmic pattern. Each line exhibits substantial variance in syllabic count and stress placement, typically comprising 2 to 3 stresses or more. Featuring a singular rhyme scheme throughout the entirety of a line, this poetic form frequently employs parallelism as a rhetorical device. Skelton himself characterized his stylistic approach as "**ragged, tattered and jagged, rudely rain-beaten, rusty and moth-eaten**," endearing himself to audiences for the distinctiveness of his craft.


领会要点：
（1）选篇1（乔叟《坎特伯雷故事集》中的片段）中的自然意象描绘了四月春光的美和生机，这些生动的自然景象唤起了读者对美好季节的欢愉感受，同时映射出人们对生活、旅行和精神寄托的渴望。

（2）选篇2（斯凯尔顿《致玛格丽特·赫西夫人》）中的重复句式强化了对玛格丽特·赫西夫人的赞美，使得诗人的情感表达更加深刻和强烈，同时也增强了诗歌的音乐性和记忆性。


In conclusion, the vivid natural imagery presented in Excerpt 1 from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales not only celebrates the beauty and vitality of April but also evokes a sense of joy and renewal, reflecting humanity's innate yearning for life's abundance, exploration, and spiritual fulfillment. Conversely, the repetitive structure evident in Excerpt 2 of Skelton's "To Mistress Margaret Hussey" serves to intensify the poet's adulation for Lady Margaret Hussey, imbuing the verse with profound emotional depth and enhancing its lyrical appeal and memorability.

应用实例：
（1）中古英语与现代英语的主要差别可以从选篇1中看出，中古英语的词汇、语法结构和发音与现代英语有所不同，比如音节数量的变化、重音位置的不固定、词汇的演变等。此外，中古英语的拼写和语法规范也与现代英语有所区别。

（2）比较选篇1与选篇2的诗体差异可见，乔叟的《坎特伯雷故事集》选段采用了抑扬格五音步的韵律结构，诗句较为规整，而斯凯尔顿的《致玛格丽特·赫西夫人》则体现了“斯凯尔顿体”的不规则特性，节奏起伏更大，韵律变化更为自由。乔叟的诗体偏向古典雅致，斯凯尔顿的诗体则更具个人色彩和创新精神。

Moreover, by comparing and contrasting the poetic styles exhibited in Excerpt 1 and Excerpt 2, a notable distinction emerges between Chaucer's adherence to iambic pentameter with a more regular verse structure in The Canterbury Tales and Skelton's embrace of the irregularities characteristic of the "Skelton style," marked by greater rhythmic variation and freedom. Chaucer's poetic expression leans towards a classical and refined demeanor, while Skelton's verse embodies a more individualistic and innovative approach.

### 四、本章重点、难点

##### 记忆要点：

**(1) 莫尔、李利和锡德尼的主要生平事迹及其代表作品**
- 托马斯·莫尔（Sir Thomas More，1478-1535）是英国文艺复兴时期的法律家、人文主义者和政治家，曾任大法官，因反对亨利八世的婚姻和宗教政策被处决，后被封为圣人。他的代表作《乌托邦》批判了当时英国社会尤其是资本主义原始积累时期“圈地运动”的不公，并提出了理想的社会治理模式。
- Sir Thomas More (1478-1535) functioned as an English Renaissance legal practitioner, scholar, and statesman who held the position of chancellor. His execution was a result of his opposition to Henry VIII's marital decisions and religious policies, leading to his subsequent canonization as a saint. The magnum opus "Utopia" offered scathing commentary on the injustices prevalent in English society at the time, particularly critiquing the "enclosure movement" during the era of early capitalist accumulation. More advanced an idealistic social governance framework within his work.

- 约翰·李利（John Lyly，约1554-1606）是伊丽莎白时代的剧作家和散文小说家，以“大学才子派”身份著称，开创了独特的“尤菲绮斯体”文体。他的代表作包括散文小说《尤菲绮斯》及其续集《尤菲绮斯和他的英格兰》。
- John Lyly (approximately 1554-1606) was a notable Elizabethan dramatist and prose writer acknowledged for his erudition, credited with establishing the distinctive "Euphuistic" literary style. His notable works include the narrative compositions "Euphues" and the subsequent "Euphues and His England".

- 菲利普·锡德尼（Sir Philip Sidney，1554-1586）同样属于文艺复兴时期的人物，既是杰出的军人、外交官，也是诗人和散文家。他的主要作品包括《五月女郎》、《阿卡迪亚》、《爱星者与星》以及文学批评著作《为诗辩护》（The Defence of Poesy），其中《为诗辩护》是对当时针对诗歌的攻击做出的有力回应。
- Sir Philip Sidney (1554-1586), also a luminary of the Renaissance epoch, excelled as a distinguished military figure, diplomat, versifier, and essayist. His notable works encompass "Astrophel and Stella", "Arcadia", "The Defense of Poesy", with the latter serving as a profound rebuttal to the criticisms leveled against poetry of his era.

**(2) 资本主义“圈地运动”发生的年代及基本历史事实**
- 英国的“圈地运动”始于15世纪末至16世纪初，尤其在16世纪中叶至19世纪中期达到高潮。这一运动伴随着封建制度解体和资本主义兴起，主要是为了发展羊毛产业和农业商业化，贵族和新兴资产阶级通过强行圈占公有地、剥夺农民土地使用权，将其变为牧场，导致大批农民失去土地，不得不进入城市成为雇佣劳动者，从而为英国资本主义原始积累提供了必要的劳动力。
- The British Enclosure Movement began in the late 15th to early 16th century, gaining substantial momentum between the mid-16th and mid-19th centuries. Coinciding with the decline of feudalism and rise of capitalism, it sought to boost the wool trade and agricultural commodification. Aristocrats and rising bourgeoisie enclosed communal lands, turning them into pastures, depriving farmers of access and forcing many into urban migration. Dispossessed peasants became wage laborers, fueling Britain's early capitalist accumulation.

**(3) “绮丽体”（Euphuism）的界定和形式特征**
- “绮丽体”由约翰·李利在其作品中创造和发展，是一种高度装饰性和复杂化的英语散文风格。其特点在于刻意运用多种修辞手法，如对偶、头韵、反复、设问等，同时融入大量古典学问和遥远知识，句子结构骈俪工整，追求华丽和修辞效果，有时甚至显得过于雕琢和冗赘。
- Coined and refined by John Lyly in his literary oeuvre, "Euphuism" embodies a highly ornate and intricate form of English prose. Notable for the deliberate integration of diverse rhetorical techniques such as parallelism, alliteration, repetition, and interrogatives, "Euphuism" incorporates an abundance of erudition and obscure knowledge. Characterized by refined and symmetrical sentence structures, it aspires toward eloquence and rhetorical flourish, occasionally bordering on excessive embellishment and redundancy.

**(4) 锡德尼《为诗辩护》的缘起**
- 《为诗辩护》是锡德尼回应斯蒂温·葛森（Stephen Gosson）的作品《恶习的学校》中对戏剧和诗歌的攻击而写的。葛森将这些文学形式贬低为无聊和堕落，而锡德尼则在文中捍卫诗歌的价值，主张诗歌不仅能够提供教益，而且在传达理念和情感方面优于哲学和历史。
- The inception of "In Defense of Poetry" can be attributed to Sidney's response to the disparagement of drama and poetry in Stephen Gosson's "The School of Vice". Gosson disparaged these literary forms as mundane and degenerate, prompting Sidney to champion the intrinsic worth of poetry. Sidney posited that poetry not only educates but surpasses philosophy and history in its capability to evoke ideas and sentiments vividly.

##### 领会内容：

**(1)** 选文反映了莫尔对“羊吃人”现象的深刻批判，揭露了资本主义原始积累过程中资本家对农民的无情剥削和社会矛盾的尖锐化。

**(2)** 选篇2体现了李利作品中“绮丽体”的具体运用，这种风格以其繁复的语言和精致的修辞构建了一种极具个性的文学审美，但在传达清晰明确的思想时可能稍显晦涩。

**(3)** “绮丽体”因其过度修饰和侧重形式美，不适合作为论说文的文体，因为它可能导致读者过分关注文字本身而非内容，进而妨碍了论述的逻辑性和说服力。

**(4)** 锡德尼在《为诗辩护》中提出，诗歌通过生动的形象和情感表达，将抽象的哲学概念和历史事件以更易感知的方式呈现出来，从而更好地触及读者的灵魂并激发共鸣，这是哲学和历史书写所不及之处。

- **(1)** The referenced excerpt underscores More's incisive critique of the phenomenon termed "sheep devour people", laying bare the ruthless exploitation of farmers by capitalists and the accentuation of societal disparities during the course of primordial capitalist accrual. 
- **(2)** The second passage exemplifies the practical manifestation of the "Euphuistic Style" in Lyly's literary works. This style erects a deeply individualistic literary aesthetic through its intricate diction and exquisite rhetoric, albeit at the risk of conveying thoughts opaquely despite their clarity and precision.
- **(3)** The "Euphuistic Style" may not be apt for polemical essays owing to its excessive adornment and emphasis on formal elegance, potentially diverting readers' attention excessively toward the text rather than the substance, thereby impeding the logical coherence and persuasive potency of the argument.
- **(4)** Sidney posited in "In Defense of Poetry" that poetry provides a more tangible presentation of abstract philosophical tenets and historical occurrences through vibrant imagery and emotive expressions, thereby eliciting a deeper resonance and inspiring the soul of readers, a feat unattainable by philosophy and historical treatises.
##### 应用示例：

**(1)** 英文总结和评论：
Sir Thomas More criticized the cruel nature of early capitalism in England through his work "Utopia", where he allegorically depicted the enclosure movement as "sheep eating men". John Lyly's "Euphues" exemplifies Euphuism, a florid and intricate style that, while artistically impressive, may hinder clarity in expository writing. Philip Sidney defended poetry in "The Defence of Poesy" against Stephen Gosson's attacks, arguing that poetry surpasses philosophy and history by vividly embodying universal truths.

**(2)** 评述选篇2的主题和语言风格：
John Lyly's "Euphues and His England" reflects the epitome of Euphuism, showcasing a highly stylized, ornate prose that revels in elaborate rhetorical devices and classical allusions. While the language is undeniably elegant and rich, its density and tendency towards excessive ornamentation can sometimes obscure straightforward communication, rendering it less effective for didactic purposes.

**(3)** 简述为何“绮丽体”不适合论说文写作：
"Euphuism," characterized by its convoluted syntax, profusion of rhetorical figures, and decorative quality, would likely impede the lucidity and directness required for persuasive argumentation in essays or discursive texts, as it could potentially distract readers from the core message.

**(4)** 评论选篇6中锡德尼的主要观点：
In "The Defence of Poesy," Sidney champions poetry for its unique ability to merge philosophical ideals and historical realities into living narratives and images, thereby achieving a synthesis that both enlightens and entertains more effectively than either philosophy or history alone. Through this approach, poetry bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and emotional engagement, enhancing understanding and memorable transmission of ethical, moral, and cultural values.
#### （二）诗歌：通读本节内容，熟读选篇2、3及相关内容。
1. 识记：（1）斯宾塞和莎士比亚的大致生平事迹和代表作及其创作年代或出版年代；（2）斯宾塞两首十四行诗的诗体形式（音步和韵脚）；（3）所选莎士比亚两首歌谣的剧本出处并背诵其中一首歌谣。
2. 领会：（1）读懂本节所列必考选诗，理解其主题和细节；（2）斯宾塞十四行诗中的主题、时间观念和戏剧意识；（3）莎士比亚戏剧歌谣中的丰富意象呈现及作用。
3. 应用：（1）用英语大致叙述本节所列必考选诗的主题内容；（2）结合用词、韵律、节奏等，简略说明莎士比亚戏剧歌谣中的音乐性。

##### 记忆要点：

**(1) 斯宾塞和莎士比亚的大致生平事迹和代表作及其创作年代或出版年代**
- **埃德蒙·斯宾塞**（Edmund Spenser, 1552-1599）是英国文艺复兴时期的伟大诗人，代表作包括长篇史诗《仙后》（The Faerie Queene, 1590-1596）、田园诗集《牧人月历》（The Shepheardes Calender, 1579）和十四行诗集《小爱神》（Amoretti, 1595）。其两首精选的十四行诗《第70首》和《第54首》出自《小爱神》系列，创作于16世纪晚期。

- **威廉·莎士比亚**（William Shakespeare, 1564-1616）是英国文艺复兴时期最杰出的戏剧家和诗人之一，代表作有长篇叙事诗《维纳斯与阿都尼》（Venus and Adonis, 1593）和《鲁克丽丝受辱记》（The Rape of Lucrece, 1594），以及戏剧如《哈姆雷特》（Hamlet, 1603）、《李尔王》（King Lear, 1608）等。所选的两首歌谣分别出自《第十二夜》（Twelfth Night, 1623）中的《O Mistress Mine, Where Are You Roaming?》和《皆大欢喜》（As You Like It, 1623）中的《Under the Greenwood Tree》。
- **Edmund Spenser** (1552-1599) emerged as a distinguished poet during the English Renaissance period. Noteworthy among his works are the epic poem The Faerie Queene (1590-1596), the pastoral collection The Shepheardes Calender (1579), and the sonnet compilation Amoretti (1595). Specifically, two sonnets selected from the Amoretti series, Sonnets 70 and 54, originated in the late 16th century
- **William Shakespeare** (1564-1616) stood out as a prominent figure in English Renaissance literature, excelling as both a dramatist and poet. His prominent works encompass long narrative poems like Venus and Adonis (1593) and The Rape of Lucrece (1594), along with renowned plays such as Hamlet (1603) and King Lear (1608). The chosen ballads are "O Mistress Mine, Where Are You Roaming?" from Twelfth Night (1623) and "Under the Greenwood Tree" from As You Like It (1623).

**(2) 斯宾塞两首十四行诗的诗体形式**
斯宾塞的十四行诗采用了一种特殊的“斯宾塞诗节”形式，每首包含三个四行诗节（quatrain）和一个尾联（couplet），韵脚排列为`abab bcbccdcdee`，这是一种不同于莎士比亚十四行诗（sonnet）的传统形式（通常是`abab cdcd efef gg`）的创新。

Spenser's sonnets adopt a distinctive form known as the "Spenserian stanza," characterized by three quatrains and a couplet, with a rhyme scheme of abab bcbccdcdee. This pattern marks an innovative departure from the conventional structure found in Shakespearean sonnets, which typically follow the abab cdcd efef gg rhyme scheme.

**(3) 所选莎士比亚两首歌谣的剧本出处**
- 《O Mistress Mine, Where Are You Roaming?》出自喜剧《第十二夜》（Twelfth Night），由剧中角色Feste演唱。
- 《Under the Greenwood Tree》出自喜剧《皆大欢喜》（As You Like It），由Lord Amiens吟唱。

##### 领会内容：

**(1)** 斯宾塞的十四行诗主题围绕爱情、时间的流逝以及个人情感的转变，展示了他对时间紧迫性的深刻洞察和对爱情的热烈追求。
- 在《第70首十四行诗》中，诗人敦促恋人珍惜当下，抓住爱情的黄金时刻。
- 《第54首十四行诗》通过戏剧隐喻，描绘了诗人与恋人间的情感互动，反映出爱情关系中的无奈与期待。
- Spenser's sonnets delve into themes of love, the transient nature of time, and the evolution of personal emotions, showcasing his profound understanding of temporal urgency and fervent pursuit of affection. In Sonnet 70, the poet implores his beloved to cherish the current moment and seize the fleeting opportunity for love. Meanwhile, Sonnet 54 portrays the emotional interplay between the poet and his lover through vivid metaphors, reflecting the yearning and expectations inherent in romantic relationships.

**(2)** 斯宾塞十四行诗中的时间观念体现在他对时机把握的重要性强调，戏剧意识则体现为他巧妙地运用对话、场景转换和角色设置等戏剧元素来构筑诗意空间。
The exploration of time within Spenser's sonnets underscores his emphasis on timing's significance, while his strategic use of dramatic elements like dialogue, scene transitions, and character dynamics serves to construct a richly evocative poetic realm.

**(3)** 莎士比亚戏剧歌谣中充满了生动而具有象征意味的自然意象，如《Under the Greenwood Tree》中的森林、鸟鸣和阳光，它们不仅仅是视觉图像，更是情感和哲理的载体，增加了戏剧的诗意和深度。
Shakespeare's dramatic ballads are infused with vibrant and symbolic natural imagery, exemplified by references to the forest, birdsong, and sunlight in "Under the Greenwood Tree." These elements not only offer visual representations but also serve as conduits for emotions and philosophical undercurrents, enhancing the poetry and depth of the theatrical narrative.
##### 应用示例：

**(1)** 斯宾塞的《第70首十四行诗》劝导情人珍惜美好的时光并接受爱情，强调现在才是行动的最好时机；而《第54首十四行诗》则借助戏剧比喻揭示了诗人对于自身感情状况的悲观看法，尽管他试图吸引爱人，但对方并未给予同等回应。
In practice, Spenser's Sonnet 70 encourages lovers to treasure moments of joy and embrace love, stressing the importance of seizing the present opportunity. In contrast, Sonnet 54 employs dramatic metaphors to unveil the poet's somber reflection on his emotional state, delineating his attempts to attract his beloved despite unequal reciprocation.

**(2)** 例如在《Under the Greenwood Tree》中，莎士比亚展现了卓越的音乐性，通过重复和对仗的韵脚、流畅的节奏以及对自然界细致入微的描写（如“绿树丛下的歌唱”，“犹如一幅会说话的画”），创造出和谐悦耳的旋律，增强了歌曲的艺术感染力，并与其讲述的诗意生活方式相互呼应。
Furthermore, in "Under the Greenwood Tree," Shakespeare exhibits exceptional musicality by employing repetitive and antithetical rhymes, fluid rhythms, and detailed nature descriptions such as "singing under the greenwood tree" and "like a talking picture." These techniques culminate in a harmonious and melodious composition that heightens the artistic allure of the ballad, resonating with the poetic essence it embodies.

#### Summary:

1. **Biographical and Key Works:**
   - **Francis Bacon (1561-1626)** was a prominent figure of the English Renaissance, known for his contributions as a philosopher, statesman, and essayist. Bacon's major works include **'The New Organon', 'The Advancement of Learning', and 'The Great Instauration'**, which reflect his groundbreaking ideas on the scientific method, empirical thinking, and the organization of knowledge. His political career saw him rise to high offices, such as Queen's Counsel, Lord Chancellor, and Viscount St. Alban, but it ended abruptly due to charges of corruption. After his fall from grace, Bacon focused on his intellectual pursuits, penning influential essays characterized by their **worldly wisdom, clear prose, parallel sentence structures, and aphoristic style**. These essays, such as "Of Parents and Children" and "Of Marriage and Single Life," offer practical insights into human relationships and societal roles, often challenging conventional wisdom while remaining grounded in the realities of the time.
   - **John Dryden (1631-1700)** was a versatile literary figure who excelled as a poet, playwright, literary critic, and translator. He was a key figure in the Restoration era, often referred to as the "Age of Dryden." Notable works include **'Marriage à la Mode', 'All for Love', 'Aureng-Zebe', 'An Essay of Dramatic Poesy', and 'A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire'**. Dryden is particularly renowned for his **neoclassical style**, characterized by **smooth meter, rhyming couplets, epic diction, balanced clauses, biting satire, and a tendency towards moralizing**. As a satirist, his **'Absalom and Achitophel'** stands out as a masterpiece of English prose satire. Additionally, his translations, especially of Virgil's 'Aeneid', are highly acclaimed. T.S. Eliot, a notable modernist, praised Dryden as a poet-playwright-critic assessing another of similar stature.


2. **Understanding Prose Passages:**
   - Bacon's essayistic style is marked by a concise, direct approach that communicates complex ideas in a readily accessible manner. He employs parallelism, aphorisms, and a logical progression of thought to convey his worldly wisdom, often addressing topics of universal relevance with a tone that is simultaneously instructive and persuasive. His essays, such as those discussing parental duties and the pros and cons of married life, exhibit a keen understanding of human nature and societal dynamics, offering timeless insights into the complexities of familial and romantic relationships.
   - Francis Bacon, in his essays on "Of Parents and Children" and "Of Marriage and Single Life," presents nuanced perspectives on these fundamental human relationships and life choices. Regarding parents and their offspring, He acknowledges the sweetness that children bring to labor, but also notes that they intensify the bitterness of misfortune and augment the cares of life while softening the remembrance of death. Bacon emphasizes the generational continuity inherent in raising children, but also points out that some of the greatest accomplishments and foundations of society have been established by childless individuals who channel their energies and resources into broader public endeavors.
   - On the topic of marriage versus single life, Bacon argues that those who marry and have children effectively become hostages to fortune, as their familial obligations can hinder grand undertakings, whether virtuous or otherwise. He observes that many of the finest works benefiting the public have sprung from the hands of unmarried or childless individuals who have metaphorically wedded and endowed the public with their talents and resources. However, he also contends that those with children should bear the greatest concern for the future, recognizing that they must pass on their most cherished legacies. Bacon acknowledges various reasons for remaining single, with liberty being a primary motivator for those who find even minor constraints unbearable. He further posits that single individuals can serve as the best friends, masters, and servants, but may lack the stability required for good citizenship due to their readiness to flee commitments.
   - **Dryden's neoclassical prose style** is distinguished by its polished elegance, adherence to classical forms, and its ability to blend serious commentary with wit and humor. In his discourse on satire, Dryden demonstrates this style by deftly navigating the boundaries between ridicule and subtlety, emphasizing the importance of ridiculing faults without resorting to crude invective. He elucidates the satirist's task as one that requires skillful manipulation of language to expose folly without causing undue offense, likening it to the artistry of a skilled executioner who can dispatch his victim with a single, precise blow rather than a brutal hacking. This sophisticated approach to satire, evident in works like 'Absalom and Achitophel', exemplifies the finesse and intellectual rigor that define Dryden's contribution to English literature.
   - 德莱顿的新古典主义散文风格以其高雅优雅、坚持古典形式，以及将严肃的评论与机智幽默融为一体的能力而著称。在他关于讽刺的论述中，德莱顿通过巧妙地驾驭嘲笑和微妙之间的界限来展示这种风格，强调嘲笑错误而不诉诸粗暴谩骂的重要性。他将讽刺作家的任务阐明为一个需要熟练的语言操纵，揭露愚蠢而不造成不必要的冒犯，比作一个熟练的刽子手的艺术，他可以用一个单一的，精确的打击，而不是野蛮的砍杀他的受害者。这种复杂的讽刺手法，在《押沙龙与阿希托费尔》等作品中很明显，体现了德莱顿对英国文学的贡献。

3. **Poetry Review:**
   - John Donne's key works include **`The Sun Rising`** and the Holy Sonnets, notably **`Death, Be Not Proud`**. Metaphysical poetry, of which Donne is a pioneer, features complex intellectual metaphors (conceits), hyperbole, and intense meditations on the self and existence. Deep symbolic or moral meanings are often revealed through the contrast or connection between seemingly unrelated things. It has a direct impact on the imagism and symbolism in modernist poetry. In `Death, Be Not Proud`, Donne employs paradoxes to undermine the power of death.
   - John Milton, a renowned poet of the Baroque era, wrote classics such as **`Paradise Lost`** (`1667`) and the poem `On Time`. John Milton's poetic style is characterized by its profound depth, intellectual rigor, and Christian spirituality. In `On Time`, he personifies Time as a hostile being, a source of human suffering, it represents the limited, change and suffering, and " Eternity " symbolizes infinity, truth and salvation. As for talent, it is both a symbol of personal talent and a profound biblical message, representing God's spiritual gifts or responsibilities to believers.
   - Milton explores the mutable nature of life, considering eternity in relation to time-bound existence.
   - 在《论时间》中，弥尔顿将“Time”人格化为一个敌对的存在，是人类苦难的根源，在诗中代表了有限、变迁与苦难，而“Eternity”象征着无限、真理与救赎。至于“talent”，它既是个人才能的象征，也含有深厚的圣经寓意，代表了神赐予信徒的精神恩赐或责任

4. **Dramatic Extract:**
   - William Shakespeare's four great tragedies (`Hamlet`, `King Lear`, `Othello`, and `Macbeth`) were written during the late 16th and early 17th century. In the selected scene from `Hamlet`, King Claudius addresses the council, demonstrating his polished rhetoric and covering up recent upheaval in the royal family. The scene encapsulates the tension between characters, especially Hamlet's inner conflict and his disdain for his uncle's manipulative speech.

**Application Question Summary**

**(1) Summarizing and Commenting on Required Passages:**
- **Bacon's Essay**: Bacon discusses parental affection and its unequal distribution among children, emphasizing the importance of balanced parenting and avoiding undue favoritism. He highlights the complexities of familial roles and societal expectations. His style is characterized by precise, insightful observations and a balance between practical advice and moral commentary.
  
- **Dryden's Satirical Approach**: Dryden elucidates the delicate art of satire, comparing it to a surgical strike that reveals folly without crudeness. In his work, he advocates for a subtle approach that goes beyond superficial expressions of grief and instead critiques society with wit and intelligence. His passage demonstrates his mastery of refined and intellectually engaging prose.

- **Poetry Analysis**: 
  - **Donne's "The Sun Rising"**: The poem uses extravagant metaphysical conceits to elevate the speaker's love to a universal scale, dismissing external temporal markers and material wealth. The central metaphor contrasts the grandeur of the sun with the lovers' private world, suggesting that love transcends time and space.
  - **Milton's "On Time"**: Milton confronts Time's relentless march, envisioning eternity's embrace after Time's end. He celebrates the eternal bliss awaiting the faithful, contrasting the fleeting nature of earthly vanity with the permanence of divine goodness. Despite Milton's blindness, he asserts faith in God's ultimate plan and the triumph of the soul over Time.

**(2) Discussing Bacon's Essayistic Style:**
Bacon's essayistic style is characterized by clarity, logic, and a structured presentation of arguments. He often employs parallelism, aphorisms, and a methodical progression of thought that reflects his empirical approach to knowledge and his advocacy for rational inquiry. His prose is dense with insight, aiming to instruct and persuade readers with a combination of empirical observation and moral reflection.

**(3) Evaluating the Style of Dryden's Selected Passage:**
Dryden's "On Satire" exemplifies the neoclassical style, characterized by measured rhythm, lucidity, and a keen sense of decorum. His prose is articulate, displaying his skill in crafting persuasive arguments that challenge traditional notions of verbal aggression in satire. Instead, he advocates for a more sophisticated and nuanced form of criticism that attacks vice subtly, making it palatable to the reader while maintaining its moral edge. 

**(4) Briefly Summarizing the Content of Dramatic Extracts:**
In the excerpt from Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, the newly crowned King Claudius addresses the court, attempting to quell concerns about his swift remarriage to Queen Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, following the death of the previous king. Hamlet, consumed by grief and disillusionment, delivers a poignant soliloquy expressing his profound disappointment with his mother and the world's perceived corruption. His introspective musings demonstrate his complex psychological state and set the stage for the ensuing tragic events.

In summary:

**Biographical Sketches and Key Works:**
- **Samuel Johnson (1709-1784)** was a British writer, literary critic, and poet known for his significant contributions to English literature. His major works include the epic poem 'London', 'The Vanity of Human Wishes', the novel 'Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia', and the annotated edition of 'The Plays of William Shakespeare'. Notably, Johnson authored the influential 'A Dictionary of the English Language', pioneering the role of a modern lexicographer. His writing style is characterized by neoclassical elegance, reason, and a certain distance, which contrasts with the simplicity of Swift's and Addison's styles. He was celebrated for his role as a literary authority and commentator within the Literary Club, and his life was chronicled by James Boswell in 'The Life of Samuel Johnson'.

- **Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)** was a prominent British historian renowned for his magnum opus 'The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire', which spanned six volumes and traced the empire's progression from its zenith to eventual collapse. Despite a sickly childhood and an unsatisfactory educational experience at Oxford, Gibbon developed a passion for solitary reading and classical studies. His historical work is distinguished by its urbane themes, vivid narrative, intricate rhetoric, and its utilization of primary sources. Gibbon's historical perspective critiques organized religion while presenting a panoramic view of the empire's downfall rooted in factors such as internal administrative weaknesses, military decline, cultural degradation, and the deterioration of education and arts.

**Understanding the Readings:**
- In 'The Idler', Johnson encourages readers towards a reflective life and underscores the importance of independent thought and self-reliance. He regretted his own indulgence in idleness and sought to instill wisdom in his audience through his moralistic and sometimes satirical essays.

- The "Letter to Lord Chesterfield" exemplifies Johnson's satirical prowess. It was written in response to Chesterfield's belated support for Johnson's dictionary project. Here, Johnson vents his frustration with the patronage system prevalent in the 18th century and indirectly asserts the independence of literary work from aristocratic influence. The letter's satirical edge is couched in a courteous yet pointed language that exposes Chesterfield's perceived indifference.

- On the theme of Roman Empire's decline, Gibbon identifies several contributory factors including prolonged peace leading to complacency and mental stagnation, erosion of martial virtues, widespread corruption, and the decline in the quality of education and arts. 长期的和平导致自满和精神停滞，军事美德的侵蚀，普遍的腐败以及教育和艺术质量的下降。

**Application:**
- Summarizing the essence of the cited texts might involve highlighting Johnson's call for intellectual engagement and critical thinking over a life of passivity, alongside appreciating the bitter-sweet irony in his open letter to Lord Chesterfield, where he rebukes the nobleman's tardy patronage with polite yet biting wit.

- Commenting on Johnson's neoclassical rationalism and refined satire, one might observe that he advocated for clarity of thought and expression, emphasizing the instructive and entertaining aspects of literature. His style, while not as simple as Swift's or as polished as Addison's, conveyed a distinctively elevated and reasoned voice.

- When evaluating Gibbon's historical outlook and stylistic features, one would praise his comprehensive approach to history and his ability to weave together multiple threads to create a grand narrative. His writing style, rich with urban sensibilities, dramatic descriptions, and ornate language, stands as a testament to the Enlightenment era's fascination with order, causality, and eloquence. Through 'The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire', Gibbon demonstrated an acute understanding of the interplay between internal decadence and external pressures in the decline of empires. 人们会称赞他对历史的全面理解，以及他将多条线索编织在一起、创造出宏大叙事的能力。他的写作风格充满了城市情感、戏剧性的描述和华丽的语言，是启蒙时代对秩序、因果关系和雄辩的迷恋的证明。通过《罗马帝国衰亡史》，吉本对帝国衰亡过程中内部衰败和外部压力之间的相互作用有着敏锐的理解。

In summary:

1. **Memorization and Understanding:**
   - **Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard by Thomas Gray**: This elegy, published in 1751, meditates on the universality of death and the equalizing nature of mortality in a rural setting. Gray reflects on the humble lives of the common people buried in the churchyard, suggesting that their unfulfilled potential and untold stories are as worthy of remembrance as the deeds of the famous. Three evocative stanzas include:
     ```text
     The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
     The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,
     The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
     And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

     Full many a gem of purest ray serene,
     The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:
     Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
     And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

     The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
     Nor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault,
     If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
     Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
     ```
   - **The Tyger by William Blake**: Published in 1794, the poem explores diverse interpretations, such as the power of creation, the presence of evil, and the complexity of the divine creator. The most striking stanza includes:
     ```text
     Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
     In the forests of the night;
     What immortal hand or eye,
     Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
     ```
   - **A Red, Red Rose by Robert Burns**: Dating from 1794, the poem highlights three main themes: love and nature, fidelity in love, and the passage of time. Burns compares his love to a blooming rose in June and a melodious tune, promising eternal devotion:
     ```text
     O my Luve's like a red, red rose
     That's newly sprung in June;
     O my Luve's like the melody
     That's sweetly play'd in tune.
     ```

   - **The Farewell by Robert Burns**: This poem expresses sorrow and separation through phrases like "musing amidst the ruins" and "wading through slaughter to a throne," reflecting the poet's inner turmoil during his contemplation of leaving his homeland.

2. **Comprehension:**
   - **Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard**: Its basic tone is somber and contemplative, using personification to emphasize the quiet dignity of the deceased and to suggest that nature itself mourns the loss of every life. 
   - **The Tyger**: Blake's choice of words and imagery is distinctive, with the tiger representing both the powerful force of creation and potentially the darker forces inherent in the universe. The lamb serves as a counterpoint, symbolizing innocence and vulnerability.
   - **Works by Robert Burns**: Burns's poetry is characterized by vibrant imagery and musicality, often using the Scottish dialect to evoke a sense of place and emotion.

3. **Application:**
   - Summarizing themes, *Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard* deals with the transience of life and the undervalued greatness of the common man. Its rhyme scheme creates a rhythmic and contemplative mood.
   - The *Tyger*'s poetic qualities lie in its terse, forceful language and its questioning of creation's dualities.
   - *A Red, Red Rose* showcases Burns's ability to convey deep romantic sentiment through direct, picturesque language and traditional Scottish rhythms.

#### Summary of Information:

**(1) Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift's Lives and Major Works:**
Daniel Defoe (1660-1731), a British writer from the 17th and 18th centuries, began his career as a merchant and gained fame late in life as a novelist. Notable among his works is "The History of the Union of Great Britain" (1709) and his first novel, "Robinson Crusoe," which was published in 1719. Crusoe's story follows a sailor who becomes marooned on a deserted island, surviving through resourcefulness and perseverance, encountering trials such as building shelter, cultivating food, and befriending a native he names Friday. Defoe's style is characterized by realistic detail, the use of the first-person narrator, and a semblance of authenticity that blurs the lines between fact and fiction.

Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), born in Dublin, initially faced challenges in his literary pursuits before establishing himself as a satirist. He is known for works such as "A Tale of a Tub" (1697) and his masterpiece, "Gulliver's Travels," published in 1726. This satirical novel features Lemuel Gulliver's journeys where he encounters fantastical societies such as the miniature Lilliputians, the giant Brobdingnagians, the intellectual yet detached Laputans, and the beastly Yahoos contrasted with the noble, intelligent horse-creatures, the Houyhnhnms.

**(2) Synopsis of "Robinson Crusoe":**
"Robinson Crusoe" tells the tale of a castaway who endures a shipwreck and spends over two decades on a deserted island, employing his wits and industry to overcome various hardships. Crusoe salvages items from the wreckage, builds shelter, learns to farm, and eventually saves and civilizes Friday. 

**(3) Marx's Comments on Robinson Crusoe:**
Marx discussed Crusoe in the context of his theory, seeing him as embodying the isolated individual producer characteristic of early capitalism. An example of the pre-capitalist man producing goods because they are useful for imminent survival, not for reproduction and profit.

**(4) Synopsis of "Gulliver's Travels":**
"Gulliver's Travels" presents a series of adventures where Gulliver visits different lands populated by miniature people (Lilliputians), giants (Brobdingnagians), floating intellectuals (Laputans), and uncivilized human-like creatures (Yahoos). Through these allegorical experiences, Swift critiques human society, government, and morality.

**(5) Difference Between “Yahoo” and “Houyhnhnm”:**
In "Gulliver's Travels," the Yahoos are depicted as brutish, disgusting human-like creatures representing the worst aspects of human nature. Conversely, the Houyhnhnms are intelligent, rational, and virtuous equine beings, symbolizing an idealized form of existence free from vice and folly.

**(6) Comprehension:**
- Defoe's and Swift's novels are grounded in realism, utilizing vivid descriptions and seemingly authentic narratives to reflect on societal issues and human condition.
- The concept of a "middle station of life" in "Robinson Crusoe" represents the pragmatic advice given by Crusoe's father to maintain a balanced lifestyle rather than seek extremes, which contrasts with Crusoe's extraordinary circumstances on the island.
- Symbolic imagery in "Robinson Crusoe," such as the stranded ship and Crusoe's resourceful actions, underscores themes of self-reliance and transformation.
- Swift views human society critically through the lens of Gulliver's adventures, revealing its follies, corruptions, and moral ambiguity.

**(7) Application:**
- **Summary of Excerpts:** 
   - From Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe," we see Crusoe's immediate response to his shipwreck, detailing his pragmatic approach to salvage and construct a raft from debris, reflecting his tenacity and resourcefulness under extreme conditions.
   - In Swift's "Gulliver's Travels," Gulliver's encounter with the Yahoos highlights Swift's portrayal of base human behavior and the ugliness of mankind as seen through the eyes of an outsider.

- **Comparison of Fictional Narratives:**
   - Both Defoe and Swift employ a first-person narrative that immerses the reader in the protagonist's experiences. Defoe focuses on Crusoe's personal journey towards self-sufficiency and moral development within a realistic framework. Swift, on the other hand, uses fantasy to satirize contemporary society, presenting a sharp critique of human behavior and institutions through exaggerated analogies and stark contrasts between the Yahoos and Houyhnhnms. While Defoe’s narrative is more directly reflective of the practicalities of survival and human potential, Swift's narrative is layered with metaphorical commentary on Enlightenment-era philosophical and ethical dilemmas.

##### Summary and Comprehension of Key Life Events and Works:

1. **William Wordsworth** (1770-1850) was a pivotal figure in English Romanticism. He experienced personal tragedies and profound spiritual awakenings that influenced his poetry. His landmark publication, *Lyrical Ballads* (1798), co-authored with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, challenged literary norms and introduced key Romantic ideas, particularly through his assertion that poetry should spring from the "primary laws of our nature" and rural life: "poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings recollected in tranquillity”. Notable poems include "The Idiot Boy," "Tintern Abbey," and "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." Living in the Lake District, his descriptions of nature reflected a deep emotional connection and philosophical contemplation.

2. **Samuel Taylor Coleridge** (1772-1834) was both a poet and a philosopher-critic of Romanticism. Known for his insightful commentary and vivid imagination, Coleridge's exploration of genius and creativity included the concept that genius combines the freshness of childhood wonder with the wisdom of maturity. His significant contributions include "Kubla Khan" and "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," while his *Biographia Literaria* (1817) delved into the philosophy of poetry and his own artistic development.

3. **Charles Lamb** (1775-1834) was renowned for his 'familiar essays,' characterized by their biographical essence, organic structure, symbolism, and conversational style. Although remembered for his poetry, Lamb's legacy lies in his prose, such as those in *Essays of Elia*. His ability to capture complex emotions succinctly and humorously in works like "The Old Familiar Faces" and "On an Infant Dying as Soon As Born" highlights his unique voice in English literature.

4. **John Henry Newman** (1801-1890) was an influential intellectual and ecclesiastical leader. He spearheaded the Oxford Movement, which sought to emphasize the Church's divine nature and sacramental life. Newman's famous definition of a "gentleman" in *The Idea of a University Defined and Illustrated* posits that a true gentleman is someone who embodies moral rectitude, rationality, and sensitivity, reflecting the virtues central to a liberal arts education.

##### Application and Analysis:

**(1)** Summarizing essential texts: The provided texts highlight the distinctive styles and contributions of these authors. Wordsworth's engagement with nature reflects the Romantic sentiment of finding divine inspiration within the ordinary, while Coleridge's musings on genius touch upon the timeless interplay between innocence and experience. Lamb's prose offers intimate insights with a dash of wit and warmth, and Newman's treatise defines a gentleman as an embodiment of both intellectual rigor and ethical grace.

**(2)** Comparing the language styles: Wordsworth's style is characterized by simplicity and directness, evoking a profound emotional response through vivid descriptions of natural scenes and experiences. Coleridge, in contrast, exhibits a more philosophical and introspective approach, using imagery and metaphysics to delve into the complexities of the human condition and the creative process.

**(3)** Newman's perspective on the "gentleman": Newman envisions a gentleman as one who not only displays refined manners and comportment but also possesses a strong moral compass, patience, and intellectual integrity. He believes that a gentleman's character transcends mere societal status, being rooted in a principled stance that balances rational thought with a deeper understanding of human nature and spirituality. Newman's gentleman is a harmonious blend of humility, resilience, and intellectual refinement.

##### Biographical Sketches:
1. **Percy Bysshe Shelley** (1792-1822) was an English Romantic poet renowned for his radical ideologies and advocacy for freedom and change. Notable works include "Prometheus Unbound" (1820), "The Mask of Anarchy" (1819), and "Ode to the West Wind" (also 1819). Shelley's literary career was marked by personal tumult and philosophical dissent, culminating in his tragic drowning in 1822.

2. **George Gordon Byron** (1788-1824), often referred to simply as Lord Byron, was another leading figure of the Romantic era. Works such as "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" (1812) and "Don Juan" (begun in 1819) established him as a masterful satirist and a voice for political and social critique. His interest in the Greek War of Independence led to his composition of "The Isles of Greece", where he reflects on Greece's former glory and calls for its liberation from Ottoman rule.

3. **John Keats** (1795-1821) was celebrated for his vivid imagery and intense emotions in poems such as "Endymion" (1818) and "Hyperion" (first version in 1818). "Ode to a Nightingale" was composed around 1819 and captures Keats's contemplation on the transient nature of life and the enduring beauty of nature. It reflects on the poet's desire to escape the confines of reality into the timeless realm of nature.

**Specific Poems:**
- **"Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802"** by William Wordsworth stands out in his oeuvre due to its unusual praise of urban beauty, specifically London, which he typically viewed as the antithesis to nature's purity. 

- **"Daffodils"** ("I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud") by Wordsworth was inspired by an encounter with a field of daffodils during a walk in the Lake District. This poem celebrates the power of nature to instill a sense of companionship and enduring happiness within the human psyche.

- **"The Isles of Greece"** from Byron's "Don Juan" exemplifies his engagement with historical and political themes. Motivated by his travels and sympathy for the Greek struggle for independence, Byron used the poem to evoke Greece's classical past and mourn its present state under foreign rule.

- **"Ode to a Nightingale"** by Keats explores themes of immortality, transience, and the relationship between the sensory world and idealized nature. Its rich language and musical quality convey the poet's longing to escape his mortal existence and merge with the eternal song of the nightingale.

##### Appreciation and Understanding:
1. **Themes and Details**: Each of these selected poems offers a distinct perspective on nature and human emotion. While Wordsworth's poems contrast urban and rural landscapes, emphasizing the restorative power of nature, Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" employs the forceful wind as a metaphor for transformative power, rebirth, and the role of the poet in society.

2. **Romanticism Characteristics**: Romantic poetry, exemplified by these selections, is characterized by its emphasis on individual feelings and experiences, the power of nature to inspire and transform, and the importance of imagination. The poets often explore the sublime, memory, and the idea that the natural world holds deeper truths than those found in civilized society.

3. **Byron’s Dual Interests**: Byron's "The Isles of Greece" displays his interest in historical events and national identity, reflecting his commitment to the Greek cause. The poem contrasts sharply with other works where he delves into themes of love, pleasure, and the fleeting nature of fame, as seen in the excerpt from the Italian tour, where the focus shifts to the transient nature of youth and the pursuit of fame in the eyes of loved ones.

##### Application:
1. **Summary of Themes and Artistic Features**: The highlighted poems cover a range of themes including the urban-sublime in Wordsworth's "Composed upon Westminster Bridge", the transcendental beauty of nature in "Daffodils", the dynamic and regenerative aspects of nature in Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind", the yearning for a lost golden age and patriotic sentiment in Byron's "The Isles of Greece", and the quest for immortal bliss through immersion in nature in Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale". Each poem showcases the artist's mastery of imagery, sound patterns, and thematic depth.

2. **Romanticism in the Selected Poems**: Romantic poetry is typified by its celebration of individual emotion, an affinity for the natural world, a fascination with the past, and a belief in the power of art to capture and communicate profound truths. The poets explored the boundaries between life and death, reality and imagination, and emphasized the subjective experience over objective reality.

3. **Comparison of Byron's Styles**: In "The Isles of Greece," Byron exhibits his characteristic blend of political engagement and melancholic reflection on history. Conversely, in the unnamed poem from his Italian tour, his style shifts to a softer, more introspective examination of love and fame, revealing a more intimate side of his character that resonates with the Romantic concern for personal relationships and the subjective interpretation of fame. Both poems display Byron's versatility in addressing various facets of the human condition, albeit with differing tones and stylistic choices.


#### (二) Poetry

1. **Recollection:**
   - **Shelley:** Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) was a precocious and imaginative child who attended Eton and University College, Oxford. Mocked as "Mad Shelley," he embraced radical ideas, married Harriet Westbrook at 19, and later Mary Godwin, author of *Frankenstein*. Shelley's early works, including *Queen Mab* (1813), espoused revolutionary principles. His prolific period from 1819 saw the completion of *Prometheus Unbound*, and the composition of celebrated odes such as *To a Skylark*, *The Cloud*, and *Ode to the West Wind*. He died tragically at age 29, but remains an icon of youthful rebellion in the liberal tradition.
   - **Byron:** George Gordon Byron (1788-1824) was born in London, developed his political and personal freedom ideals at Cambridge, and gained fame with *Childe Harold's Pilgrimage* (1812). Known for his scandals, flamboyance, and radicalism, Byron traveled extensively and supported the Greek struggle for independence. His epic satire *Don Juan* was published in parts from 1819, and his lyric poem "The Isles of Greece" reflects his passion for Greek liberation and disillusionment with the nation's fallen glory.
   - **Keats:** John Keats (1795-1821) lost both parents at a young age and began his poetic career in 1810. His early works, including *Endymion*, established him as a leading Romantic figure. His "Great Year" of 1818 produced masterpieces like *Hyperion*, *Ode to a Nightingale*, and *Ode on a Grecian Urn*. Keats died at 26, but his poetry, emphasizing the beauty of nature, the power of imagination, and the transience of life, continues to resonate.

   **Specialty of "Composed upon Westminster Bridge":** In this sonnet, Wordsworth breaks from his usual depiction of cities as antithetical to nature, finding unexpected beauty and serenity in an early morning London scene. This deviation highlights the poet's ability to perceive transcendental beauty in the mundane.

   **Background of "Daffodils":** Inspired by a walk in the Lake District, Keats crafted this poem after encountering a "crowd" of daffodils. The poem explores the lasting impact of nature on the human soul and the solace it provides in times of reflection and solitude.

   **Origin & Motivation of "The Isles of Greece":** From *Don Juan*, "The Isles of Greece" is a call to the Greeks to rise against Ottoman tyranny. It reflects Byron's deep engagement with the Greek cause and his despair over the loss of their ancient glory.

2. **Understanding:**
   - **Themes & Details:** Each poem presents distinct themes: Wordsworth's sonnets reveal the transformative power of nature and its ability to evoke profound emotions; Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" explores the force of nature, the role of poetry, and the cycle of life and death; Byron's "The Isles of Greece" mourns Greece's fallen grandeur and advocates for its liberation; "All for Love" focuses on the fleeting nature of fame and its true value in the eyes of a loved one.
   - **Romantic Emotions in Nature Imagery:** In Wordsworth's poems, the tranquil London dawn and the dancing daffodils serve as vehicles for the sublime, evoking feelings of awe, tranquility, and a connection to the eternal.
   - **Theme & Artistic Impact of "Ode to the West Wind":** Shelley's poem delves into the dual nature of the West Wind as a destructive yet regenerative force, paralleling the transformative power of poetry and the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Its powerful imagery and passionate language create a profound emotional and philosophical impact.
   - **Historical Imagination in "The Isles of Greece":** Byron evokes the glories of ancient Greece and contrasts it with the nation's contemporary subjugation, expressing a longing for the restoration of its former greatness.
   - **Theme & Language Artistry in "Ode to a Nightingale":** Keats meditates on the transitory nature of human existence, the allure of escape into the timeless realm of art and nature, and the redemptive potential of poetic imagination. The poem showcases his rich sensory descriptions, musicality, and philosophical depth.

3. **Application:**
   - **Summary of Theme, Content, & Artistic Features:** The selected poems encompass themes of nature's transformative power, the cycle of life and death, the interplay between art and reality, political oppression and liberation, and the fleeting nature of fame. Each piece displays the poets' mastery of vivid imagery, emotional depth, and philosophical contemplation characteristic of Romantic literature.
   - **Characteristics of Romantic Poetry (Illustrated by the Selections):** Romantic poetry is characterized by a celebration of nature, the elevation of individual emotion and imagination, a fascination with the supernatural and transcendent, a critique of societal norms and political oppression, and a strong emphasis on the power of art to capture and convey these experiences. The selected poems exemplify these traits through their focus on the sublime in nature, the introspective journey of the self, and the transformative potential of artistic expression.
   - **Comparison of Byron's Poetic Interests & Styles:** "The Isles of Greece" demonstrates Byron's commitment to political activism and his ability to infuse historical and cultural themes with personal passion. The poem's somber tone and elegiac quality reflect his deep empathy for Greece's plight. In contrast, "All for Love" exhibits a lighter touch, exploring the fleeting nature of fame and its true worth in a more personal, intimate context. The differing styles showcase Byron's versatility in addressing both public and private concerns, utilizing both serious historical reflection and witty, conversational lyricism.

##### 1. 识记
**(1)** Charles Dickens drew inspiration for his works of critical realism from three main sources: first, autobiographical personal experiences, such as the portrayal of an abandoned child's life in _Oliver Twist_ and the incorporation of his godfather's shadow into characters in _Dombey and Son_; second, profound insights into contemporary social issues, as seen in _Hard Times_' critique of the flaws of utilitarianism within the context of the Industrial Revolution, and _Little Dorrit_'s examination of bureaucratic corruption in the commercial sector; third, the appropriation and adaptation of traditional novelistic narrative techniques to contemporaneous societal phenomena. 查尔斯·狄更斯在创作其批判现实主义小说时，灵感主要来源于三个方面：一是自传性的个人经历，例如《雾都孤儿》中描绘的弃儿生活和《董贝父子》中他把教父的影子融入角色；二是对当时社会问题的深度洞察，如通过《艰难时世》反映工业革命背景下功利主义思想的缺陷，以及《小杜丽》对商业官僚制度的剖析；三是借鉴传统小说叙事技巧，并将其与当代社会现象相结合。

**(2)** Irony as a literary device involves using contradictions or exaggerations between surface expression and underlying meaning to subtly yet pointedly ridicule and criticize a particular subject. In Dickens' novels, as exemplified by _Pride and Prejudice_ and _Persuasion_, irony manifests in subtle revelations about societal class prejudices, marriage customs, and human weaknesses, such as Mrs. Bennet's materialistic aspirations for her daughters' marital advancements and the satirical depictions of pretentious behavior in social settings in _Persuasion_. 反讽语言艺术是一种文学手法，它通过表面表达与实际含义之间的矛盾或夸张，对某一对象进行委婉而尖锐的嘲讽和批评。在狄更斯的小说中，诸如《傲慢与偏见》和《劝导》这样的作品，反讽体现在对社会阶级观念、婚姻习俗和人性弱点的微妙揭示上，如对班纳特夫人期望女儿攀高枝的世俗心态，以及对《劝导》中社交场合的虚伪做派的描绘。

**(3)** The motif of the "madwoman in the attic" originates from Charlotte Brontë's _Jane Eyre_. Within the novel, this scene symbolizes the constraints and repression imposed upon women by society, with Bertha Mason, the madwoman confined to the attic, embodying suppressed madness, repressed passion, and the marginalized destiny forced upon women. Brontë employs this construct to challenge Victorian-era stereotypes regarding women's mental health and marital morality. “阁楼里的疯女人”场景源自夏洛蒂·勃朗特的《简·爱》。在小说中，这一场景是对社会强加于女性的束缚和压抑的象征，疯女人伯莎·梅森被关在阁楼上，代表着隐藏的疯狂、被压制的激情和女性被迫的边缘化命运。勃朗特通过这一设置挑战了维多利亚时代对女性精神健康和婚姻道德的刻板印象。

##### 2. 领会


**(1)** In _Pride and Prejudice_, Jane Austen illustrates, through the marriage pressures faced by the five Bennet sisters—particularly Elizabeth Bennet's romance with Mr. Darcy—the economic and social dependence of women on marriage, along with their resistance and self-awareness in the face of such pressures. In _Persuasion_, Austen's distinctive use of irony is evident through the portrayal of Anne Elliot's tumultuous relationship with Captain Wentworth and her sharp satire of Bath society, offering a penetrating critique of Victorian social customs and interpersonal relationships.

**(2)** Dickens' realist style is manifest in his meticulous depiction of the living conditions of the lower classes, as seen in the wealth disparities in _Dombey and Son_ and the social injustices in _Oliver Twist_. His critical sensibility is evident in his in-depth analyses of social issues specific to their historical contexts, coupled with deep empathy for his characters' fates and explorations of human nature.

**(3)** The central conflict in _Jane Eyre_ revolves around Jane's love entanglement with Mr. Rochester, particularly the struggle for equality in marriage and social standing, which embodies a strong feminist undercurrent. Jane resolutely opposes the notion of sacrificing personal dignity for economic security in marriage, emphasizing that women should possess independent personalities and the right to make autonomous choices.

**(1)** 简·奥斯汀在《傲慢与偏见》中，通过班纳特家五个女儿的婚姻压力，尤其是伊丽莎白·班纳特与达西的爱情故事，展现了女性对于经济和社会地位的婚姻依赖，以及对此的反抗与自我认知。而在《劝导》中，奥斯汀通过对安妮·艾略特与温特沃斯船长曲折恋情的描绘，以及对巴斯街头人物的辛辣讽刺，体现了她独特的反讽艺术，对维多利亚时代社会风俗和人际关系进行了深刻的审视。

**(2)** 狄更斯的现实主义笔法体现在他精细刻画社会底层人民的生活状况，如《董贝父子》中的贫富差距和《雾都孤儿》中的社会不公。他的批判意识体现在对特定时代背景下的社会问题深入剖析，以及对人物命运的深刻同情与人性挖掘。

**(3)** 《简·爱》中的主要矛盾冲突围绕着简·爱与罗切斯特先生的爱情纠葛展开，尤其是在婚姻平等与社会地位上的斗争，这一矛盾体现了强烈的女性主义色彩，简·爱坚决抵制以牺牲个人尊严换取经济保障的婚姻观，强调女性应具有独立人格与自主选择的权利。

##### 3. 应用


**(1)** Among the selected texts, Dickens' _Dombey and Son_ narrates the familial strife between businessman Paul Dombey and his daughter Florence, tracing her growth and romantic resolution against the backdrop of societal change. Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_ explores Elizabeth Bennet's journey in the marriage market and her commitment to genuine love. _Persuasion_ portrays Anne Elliot's overcoming external pressures and internal doubts to reignite her relationship with a former love interest. Charlotte Brontë's _Jane Eyre_ presents the protagonist's growth amidst gender discrimination and romantic trials through a distinctively female lens, while Emily Brontë's _Wuthering Heights_ weaves a tale of family vendettas, love's revenge, and the complexities of human nature within a tragic atmosphere.

**(2)** The primary conflict in _Jane Eyre_ centers on the tension between Jane's individual independence and societal expectations, as well as the disparity in status and romantic pursuit between her and Mr. Rochester. By rejecting adherence to conventional marriage norms and upholding principles of personal dignity and love's equality, Jane embodies the feminist core tenet that women have the right to choose their partners and maintain independence in economic, emotional, and psychological terms.

**(3)** Thomas Hardy's novels, such as _Tess of the d'Urbervilles_, convey a sense of fatalism, as exemplified by Tess's tragic life, which demonstrates an individual's powerlessness and tragic fate in the face of overwhelming societal forces. Despite Tess's valiant struggles, her inevitable tragic conclusion underscores the deterministic nature of her story.

Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) was a British novelist, essayist, and critic known for her pioneering work in modernist literature. Born into a privileged intellectual environment in London, her life was marked by personal tragedies and struggles with mental health issues. Among her significant works are 'Jacob's Room' (1922), 'Mrs. Dalloway' (1925), 'To the Lighthouse' (1927), and 'A Room of One's Own' (1929), where she famously argues for financial independence and a physical space as prerequisites for women's creativity. Her stream-of-consciousness narrative technique revolutionized fiction, emphasizing the fragmented and emotional aspects of human experience. In "The Death of the Moth," Woolf poetically portrays life's struggle and mortality through the plight of a moth, reflecting her deep empathy and existential contemplation.

Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), on the other hand, was a British philosopher, mathematician, and logician who made substantial contributions to both analytical philosophy and mathematics. His notable works include 'The Principles of Mathematics' (1903), 'The Analysis of Mind' (1921), and 'A History of Western Philosophy' (1945). Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his lucid prose and intellectual depth. From his autobiography, he shared his guiding principles—the longing for love, the quest for knowledge, and an overwhelming pity for the suffering of mankind. In "How to Grow Old," Russell metaphorically compares life to a river merging serenely into eternity and advises approaching old age with ease, suggesting that wisdom and experience should lead to acceptance and tranquility rather than fear or regret.

In "The Death of the Moth," Woolf's language vividly contrasts life and death, encapsulating the inherent drive for existence and the inevitable end that all creatures face. The essay reflects on the indomitable will to live and the fleeting nature of individual lives.

In Russell's writing, his literary style is characterized by clarity, wit, and profundity, evident in his discussions of growing old and living a life rich in passion and purpose. His metaphorical description of life as a river flowing into the eternal suggests a graceful progression through life stages, offering an aesthetic perspective on aging that underscores the importance of engaging with the wider world beyond oneself.

Application:

- In summarizing the essential texts, "The Death of the Moth" by Woolf demonstrates the impermanence and valiant fight against mortality, while Russell's piece teaches that a fulfilling life involves embracing experiences without anxiety about the future or obsession over personal gains, especially in old age.

- Woolf's "The Death of the Moth" employs a poignant, introspective style to explore themes of life’s vitality, struggle, and ultimate surrender to fate, highlighting the transience and preciousness of existence through the simple yet dramatic episode of a moth's brief life.

- Reflecting on Russell's ideas about life, his belief that passion and reason can coexist harmoniously resonates deeply. The notion that one should expand their interests beyond their own sphere, allowing life's journey to enrich others and merge seamlessly with the broader fabric of humanity, offers a wise and inclusive approach to aging gracefully and meaningfully.

#### （二）诗歌：通读本节内容，熟读选篇2、4及相关内容。
1. 识记：（1）叶芝和奥登的大致生平事迹和代表作及其出版年代；（2）《当你老了》的写作动机；（3）背诵《当你老了》的第一节 和《我们的偏见》的第二节 。
   - **叶芝（W. B. Yeats）**：爱尔兰诗人威廉·巴特勒·叶芝（1865-1939）是一位浪漫主义和现代主义过渡时期的杰出诗人，他的代表作有《第二次降临》（1919）和《当你年老时》（1893）。《当你年老时》是叶芝对爱情持久与时光流逝主题的深刻表达，被认为是对他与爱尔兰女演员兼民族主义者莫德·冈关系的反映。
   - **奥登（W. H. Auden）**：英国诗人W.H.奥登（1907-1973）在其职业生涯中有显著的变化和发展，其代表作如《焦虑的时代》（1947），体现了他对现代社会心理状态的深入剖析。《斯芬克斯》和《我们的偏见》展示了他独特而深刻的思考方式，其中《斯芬克斯》是对W.B.叶芝作品中象征物的再创造，而《我们的偏见》探讨了人类对时间认知的主观性和局限性。

2. 领会：（1）读懂本节所列必考选诗，理解其主题和细节；（2）叶芝《二次降灵》对一战后人类社会的幻灭和未来的悲观；（3）《当你老了》的主题以及诗歌修辞手法；（4）奥登《斯芬克斯》中的象征意义以及语言风格；（5）《我们的偏见》中人类行为与时间之间的关系。
   - 叶芝的《第二次降临》通过对世界末日前兆的描绘，反映了他对第一次世界大战后人类社会秩序崩溃和未来悲观前景的深刻认识。
   - 《当你老了》以其温柔而又哀婉的笔触，讲述了一种爱情的理想化期待与时光无情消逝的对照，使用了直接对话和未来设想的修辞手法来增强情感的穿透力。
   - 奥登的《斯芬克斯》一诗借用了叶芝《第二次降临》中的怪物象征，以一种静默却具有强大象征力量的形象唤起读者对时间和命运的思考。
   - 在《我们的偏见》中，奥登讨论了人类行为如何受到对时间认识的偏见影响，提出客观时间并不能限制人类基于主观时间观念追求成功与爱的努力。

3. 应用：（1）用英语大致叙述本节所列必考选诗的主题内容和艺术特色；（2）简略评述叶芝诗歌与浪漫主义诗歌的主题与语言风格的区别；（3）简略评述奥登两首选诗的韵律区别。
   - 叶芝的《第二次降临》以强烈的历史感和对现代危机的独特洞察为主题，艺术特色在于其富有象征意味的意象和暗含的社会批判；《当你老了》则以细腻的情感和对未来场景的预设展现了一种超越时空的爱情表白。
   - 叶芝的诗歌虽然深受浪漫主义影响，但他后期的作品转向了更加现代和复杂的主题，比如《第二次降临》体现了一种超脱于单纯浪漫情怀的现实主义和悲观情绪，语言风格更为深沉且富含象征寓意，而早期浪漫主义诗歌更侧重于自然美和个人情感的抒发。
   - 奥登的两首诗在韵律上有明显的差异，《斯芬克斯》可能更注重象征意象的构建和内在节奏的微妙变化，而《我们的偏见》可能会在探讨抽象概念时展现出更为冷静、理智的语言节奏，两者都体现了奥登对于诗歌韵律与主题紧密贴合的艺术追求。

1. **Recall**
   - **W.B. Yeats**: William Butler Yeats (1865-1939), an Irish poet, was a prominent figure straddling the Romantic and Modernist periods. Notable works include "The Second Coming" (1919) and "When You Are Old" (1893). The latter is a poignant meditation on enduring love amidst the passage of time, widely regarded as a reflection of Yeats' relationship with Maud Gonne, the Irish actress and nationalist.
   - **W.H. Auden**: British poet W.H. Auden (1907-1973) underwent significant evolution throughout his career. Representative pieces such as "The Age of Anxiety" (1947) demonstrate his incisive examination of the psychological state of modern society. "The Sphinx" and "Our Bias" exhibit his distinctive and profound thought processes; while "The Sphinx" reinterprets symbolic elements from W.B. Yeats' works, "Our Bias" explores the subjectivity and limitations of human perception of time.

2. **Comprehension**
   - Yeats' "The Second Coming" portrays portents of the apocalypse, reflecting his acute awareness of societal collapse following World War I and a bleak outlook for the future.
   - "When You Are Old" tenderly yet mournfully contrasts an idealized vision of love with the inexorable erosion of time, employing direct address and imagined future scenarios to heighten emotional resonance.
   - In "The Sphinx," Auden appropriates the monster symbol from Yeats' "The Second Coming" to evoke contemplation of time and destiny through a silent, powerfully symbolic figure.
   - "Our Bias" discusses how human actions are influenced by biases in our understanding of time, arguing that objective time does not constrain human endeavors based on subjective temporal perceptions, such as the pursuit of success and love.

3. **Application**
   - Yeats' "The Second Coming" centers on a strong sense of history and unique insight into modern crises, characterized artistically by its richly symbolic imagery and implicit social critique; whereas "When You Are Old" presents an eternal love declaration through delicate emotions and envisioned future scenes.
   - Although deeply influenced by Romanticism, Yeats' later poetry shifts towards more modern and intricate themes; for instance, "The Second Coming" transcends mere romantic sentimentality with realism and pessimism, adopting a deeper, more symbol-laden language style compared to earlier Romantic poems which emphasized natural beauty and personal emotion.
   - Auden's two poems likely exhibit distinct rhythmic qualities: "The Sphinx" may prioritize the construction of symbolic imagery and subtle variations in internal rhythm, while "Our Bias" may display a cooler, more rational linguistic tempo when exploring abstract concepts. Both demonstrate Auden's artistic commitment to harmonizing poetic meter with theme.

**David Herbert Lawrence (D.H. Lawrence):**
- Lawrence (1885-1930) was an English writer who grew up amidst poverty and familial strife. He gained recognition for his literary prowess after publishing *The White Peacock* (1911), *Sons and Lovers* (1913), and notably, *The Rainbow* (1915), which was initially suppressed due to its exploration of sexuality and bodily experience, themes that challenged Victorian sensibilities. His novel *Lady Chatterley's Lover* (1928) faced immediate banning for its explicit sexual content.

**Joseph Conrad:**
- Born in 1857 and passing away in 1924, Conrad's life experiences deeply influenced his works. He voyaged extensively, which informed his writings including *Heart of Darkness* (1899). This novel critiques the harsh realities of European imperialism and the breakdown of human connection across racial and social barriers. Conrad employed symbolism and impressionistic techniques to convey his thematic concerns.

**E.M. Forster:**
- Forster (1879-1970) was a celebrated English novelist who examined the English class system in depth, as seen in novels such as *Howards End* (1910) and *A Passage to India* (1924). Besides his fiction, Forster contributed significantly to literary theory through his book *Aspects of the Novel* (1927), which remains a seminal text in understanding the art of fiction.

**Stream of Consciousness Technique:**
- This narrative device, prominently used by James Joyce, captures the continuous flow of a character's thoughts and perceptions, allowing for a less structured and more intuitive portrayal of consciousness. In *Ulysses*, Joyce exemplifies this technique, presenting a non-linear, intimate insight into his characters' minds, especially in the chapter featuring Molly Bloom's internal monologue.

**Themes and Contextual Analysis:**
- **D.H. Lawrence:** His novels challenge traditional societal norms, particularly those related to sexuality and human relationships. The suppression of *The Rainbow* underscores the resistance to open discussion of such subjects in his era.
  
- **E.M. Forster:** In "London: An Inexplicable City" as depicted in *Howards End*, Forster portrays a London beset by industrial pollution and disconnectedness, illustrating a loss of traditional values and human interconnectedness in the face of urbanization and commercial growth.

- **Joseph Conrad:** *Heart of Darkness* uses symbolic imagery and impressionistic storytelling to criticize imperialism and depict the moral decay inherent in colonial endeavors. The setting of the Congo represents a metaphorical 'dark center,' highlighting the darker aspects of humanity under colonial rule.

- **Application:**
  - *Selection from "The Rainbow"* by Lawrence discusses the transformational experience of becoming a father and the tender moments shared between Anna and Will in the midst of societal changes.
  - The London described in Forster's work symbolizes a darkened metropolis, reflecting a decline in the empathetic and humane spirit of society amidst rapid industrialization.
  - A brief summary of Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* might emphasize Marlow's journey up the Congo River and his encounter with Kurtz, encapsulating the moral abyss of colonial enterprise.
  - An analysis of *Ulysses*' narrative details could demonstrate how Joyce's use of stream of consciousness creates a vivid portrait of inner lives, with the example of Molly Bloom's soliloquy showcasing the fluidity and unpredictability of thought processes.

**Why London is also considered a 'dark center':**
London is considered a "dark center" in "Heart of Darkness" because Conrad employs it as a powerful symbol of the moral decay, hidden brutality, and systemic exploitation associated with European imperialism. By drawing parallels between the darkness of the African wilderness and the darkness lurking within the heart of the imperial capital, Conrad exposes the hypocrisy of Western claims to civilization and progress, suggesting that the darkness is an inherent part of the imperial enterprise and the societies that sustain it.

**John James Osborne:**
John James Osborne (1929-1994) was a significant figure in 20th-century British drama, famous for his incisive portrayals of disillusionment and dissatisfaction within the British middle class. His breakthrough came with the production of his third play, "Look Back in Anger" (1956), which defined the term "Angry Young Men," referring to a group of post-war British writers who critiqued the traditional establishment and reflected the frustrations of a generation. Osborne's work showcased a brutal honesty with language and themes, inspiring future playwrights with its unconventional style.

**"Angry Young Men" Literary Movement:**
The "Angry Young Men" movement was characterized by a body of literature and drama that emerged in the UK during the 1950s. These works often depicted the lives of young, intelligent, working-class men who felt stifled by the class system and were disillusioned with the promises of the previous generation. They were marked by their rejection of conventional values and their desire for authenticity and change.

**Synopsis of "Look Back in Anger":**
The play centers around Jimmy Porter, his wife Alison, and their flatmate Cliff. Set in the Midlands, the story revolves around the marital and interpersonal conflicts exacerbated by Jimmy's anger at what he perceives as a stagnant and hypocritical society. In the selected segments from Act I, we see Jimmy's verbal aggression towards Alison and Cliff, a manifestation of his frustration with his own circumstances and his critique of their complacency.

**Characters and Dramatic Conflict in the Selection:**
- **Jimmy Porter**: A disillusioned intellectual who feels trapped in a life that doesn't match his ambitions. His anger is directed at everyone, including his wife, whom he sees as detached from reality and complicit in maintaining the status quo. His speech patterns are characterized by sarcasm, bitterness, and a sense of superiority mingled with insecurity.
  
- **Alison Porter**: Jimmy's wife, from a more affluent background, struggling to cope with Jimmy's constant railing and her own feelings of inadequacy. She is passive yet perceptive, and her quiet suffering contrasts with Jimmy's overt expressions of discontent.

- **Cliff**: The flatmate who serves as a mediator between Jimmy and Alison. Although he's often the target of Jimmy's abuse, he maintains a levelheaded demeanor and a loyalty that belies the chaos surrounding him.

In the specific excerpts from Act I, Jimmy's boredom and disgust with everyday life reach boiling points, revealing his existential ennui and a sense of alienation from society. Each character's dialogue reflects their unique position within the social hierarchy and their respective responses to Jimmy's angst-ridden behavior.

**Applying Insights:**
- **Character Relationships & Dramatic Conflict**: Jimmy's frustration and anger create tension with both Alison and Cliff, who represent different facets of the British society he despises. While Alison embodies the conservative upper-middle class, Cliff is an everyman caught in the crossfire of Jimmy's tirades. The conflict arises from Jimmy's inability to reconcile his deep love for Alison with his disdain for her social background and perceived lack of passion.

- **Different Forms of Anger & Causes**: Jimmy's anger is primarily existential and politically charged, fueled by his perception of a decaying society that refuses to change. Alison's silent unhappiness and eventual departure stem from her own disappointment in the marriage and Jimmy's treatment of her. Cliff's subdued reactions suggest a stoic acceptance of life's limitations, possibly rooted in a working-class pragmatism that contrasts sharply with Jimmy's revolutionary aspirations. 

In conclusion, the scene selections from "Look Back in Anger" showcase the complexity of interpersonal relations and the deep-seated dissatisfaction of the main characters, with Jimmy's simmering anger at the heart of the dramatic tension. Each character's dialogue and actions serve to highlight the generational and class-based divisions that defined the Angry Young Men movement.

In the section on Prose, we learn about William Bradford, a central figure among the Pilgrims who sailed aboard the Mayflower. Born in Yorkshire, England, Bradford joined the Separatist movement at a young age and eventually led the group to found Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620. Serving as governor for over three decades, he played a pivotal role in the signing of the Mayflower Compact, a foundational document for self-governance among the settlers. Bradford chronicled the Pilgrims' journey from their English exile to establishing the colony in his magnum opus, "Of Plymouth Plantation," written between 1630 and 1651. This work, notable for its clear, concise prose and subtle humor, provides a vivid account of the challenges the colonists faced, including harsh environmental conditions, scarce resources, and the need to establish alliances with Native Americans who would later suffer devastating losses due to European diseases.

In Poetry, we encounter two significant colonial poets:

1. Anne Bradstreet, considered America's first published poet, was born in England and immigrated to Massachusetts in 1630. In her poem "Contemplations" (excerpted), she contemplates the natural world and reflects on the transience of human existence against the backdrop of autumnal scenes. Through rich imagery and introspective musings, Bradstreet draws parallels between the fleeting beauty of nature and the impermanence of human life. Her poetry often intertwines personal experiences and domestic life with profound philosophical insights.

2. Edward Taylor, another influential colonial poet, is renowned for his metaphysical style reminiscent of John Donne. In "Upon a Spider Catching a Fly," Taylor uses the allegory of a spider ensnaring a fly to symbolize Satan's attempts to lead men into sin. The spider represents the devil, while the fly signifies an innocent believer falling prey to temptation. This poem exemplifies Taylor's complex syntax, striking metaphors, and the way he integrates religious themes into his work, highlighting the Puritan fear of moral corruption and the importance of vigilance against Satan's schemes.

To summarize key points for application:

- William Bradford's narrative captures the immediate struggles of the Pilgrims upon arrival in North America, detailing the Mayflower's crossing with 102 passengers and crew, arriving near Cape Cod on November 21, 1620, and the signing of the Mayflower Compact before settling in Plymouth.

- Early Puritan settlers encountered pressing survival issues such as shelter, sustenance, and protection from the elements, while grappling with internal divisions and external threats, including fears of Native American interaction.

- In Anne Bradstreet's "Contemplations," the poet's connection with nature serves as a metaphor for human fragility and mortality, using assonance and alliteration to create a cohesive poetic voice.

- Edward Taylor's poetry reflects Puritan faith through symbolic representations, such as the spider and fly, and employs unconventional meter and conceits to deliver moral lessons and explore theological concepts within the context of colonial America. 

Students are expected to comprehend and summarize the texts accurately, describe the critical survival challenges faced by the early Puritans, articulate the religious underpinnings in both prose and poetry, and recognize the distinctive literary qualities of each poet's work, including the use of imagery, symbolism, and rhetorical devices. Additionally, students are encouraged to recite specific sections of Bradstreet's "Contemplations" and explain the thematic depth and stylistic uniqueness of both poets' works.

### 四、本章重点、难点

本章重点：布雷兹特里特和泰勒诗歌的主题和诗体形式。
本章难点：美国早期清教移民书写和诗歌中的宗教意识。

The religious consciousness in the writings and poetry of early Puritan immigrants in America, exemplified by figures such as William Bradford, Anne Bradstreet, and Edward Taylor, was profound and integral to their work. Their literary expressions were profoundly influenced by their devout Calvinist beliefs, the hardships they faced during settlement, and their quest for a pure and unadulterated Christian community.

**William Bradford's "Of Plymouth Plantation"** chronicles the founding of Plymouth Colony and is imbued with religious purpose. The text reflects a Providential worldview where every event is seen as part of God's plan, and the Pilgrims' trials are interpreted as tests of faith and opportunities for divine intervention. The Mayflower Compact, signed by Bradford and others, was a social covenant based on biblical principles and aimed at maintaining order and ensuring religious freedom according to their interpretation of Scripture.

**Anne Bradstreet's poetry** frequently explores her religious convictions and personal relationship with God. Despite being immersed in the domestic sphere, Bradstreet's works often grapple with the Puritan ideals of predestination, humility, and the struggle between earthly attachments and spiritual aspirations. In her poem "Contemplations," she meditates on the temporality of human existence compared to the eternal, expressing a sense of awe and humility before the Creator. Bradstreet’s poems also demonstrate a balance between accepting her roles as a wife and mother and contemplating deeper theological truths, revealing a Puritan mindset that intertwined the mundane with the sacred.

**Edward Taylor's poetry**, similarly steeped in Puritan theology, uses metaphorical language to convey spiritual messages. His poem "Upon a Spider Catching a Fly" allegorically portrays the dangers of sin and Satan's allure, reflecting the Puritan fear of damnation and the need for constant vigilance against moral corruption. Taylor's work, like that of his contemporaries, is characterized by complex metaphysical constructs, classical allusions, and a focus on the individual's spiritual journey. His devotional poetry, particularly in "Preparatory Meditations," demonstrates the Puritan emphasis on introspection, repentance, and redemption.

Overall, the religious consciousness of early Puritan writers in America was manifest in their efforts to interpret everyday life and experiences through the lens of God's will, the significance of covenant relationships, the sanctity of marriage and family, and the eternal consequences of earthly actions. Their writings reflect a deep-seated belief in the direct influence of God on their lives and the centrality of scripture to their understanding of the world and their place in it. This consciousness also shaped their approach to nature, seeing it as evidence of God's presence and an opportunity for meditation on divine attributes and human frailties.

In summary:

**Michel-Guillaume Jean de Crèvecoeur & Benjamin Franklin: Key Life Events & Works**
- Michel-Guillaume Jean de Crèvecoeur (1735-1813) was a naturalized American author who observed and chronicled life in pre-revolutionary America. His significant contribution, "Letters from an American Farmer" (1782), particularly the celebrated letter titled "What Is an American?", encapsulates the complex nature of early American identity. Born in Caen, France, Crèvecoeur migrated to North America, serving as a surveyor and military officer before settling down and becoming a British subject. He coined the concept of America as a "melting pot," where individuals from various European backgrounds mixed to form a new kind of person. His writings highlight how American colonists transcended their old cultural identities and formed a new one based on survival instincts and the principles of self-governance within an agrarian society.

- Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), often revered as an "American saint," significantly influenced American politics, society, and intellect during the 18th century. A self-made man born in Boston, Franklin had limited formal education but achieved remarkable success in business, politics, and literature. His autobiography and aphorisms from "Poor Richard's Almanack" promote values like thrift, industry, and frugality derived from his Puritan background, reinterpreted in a secular context. Franklin advocated for the importance of education for the future greatness of the nation and exemplified civic engagement by demonstrating the power of private voluntary efforts. He embodied the ethos of the "American Dream," rising from humble beginnings to prominence through hard work, intelligence, and commitment.

**Early American Cultural Identity**
- The immigrants to America were characterized by a lack of unified cultural identity. They arrived from diverse European regions with no shared heritage and forged a new identity in response to religious fervor and the struggle to survive. As described by Crèvecoeur, Americans emerged as a hybrid people, discarding European feudalism and embracing self-rule in a new agrarian democracy.

**"The American Dream"**
- The "American Dream" refers to the idea, especially prevalent during the colonial era and later periods, that in America, all individuals are created equal and can achieve prosperity and success through their perseverance, courage, and dedication. Franklin's narrative of arriving in Philadelphia impoverished and eventually attaining success embodies this ideal.

**Literary Devices & Themes**
- In "Letters from an American Farmer," Crèvecoeur employs vivid descriptions and contrasts to articulate the paradoxical nature of the American character—a blend of contradictions such as being both puritanical and hedonistic, and both isolationist and interventionist. His writing style reflects an attempt to capture the essence of the "new man" emerging in America.

- Franklin's prose is renowned for its simplicity, clarity, and directness. His account of arriving in Philadelphia illustrates the journey of a young man confronting adversity, humility, and hunger, setting a stage for the development of his iconic persona. This episode underscores the significance of personal resilience and the opportunities present in the nascent democratic society.

**Application Examples**
- A brief English summary of the essential texts might emphasize Crèvecoeur's portrayal of early Americans as a culturally mixed group, shedding their old allegiances to build anew, and Franklin's personal story embodying the self-made man archetype, highlighting the transformative power of individual will and societal support.

- The main rhetorical devices used in "Letters from an American Farmer" include metaphorical imagery (the "melting pot"), contrast, and anecdotal evidence to illustrate the complexity of the American character.

- Franklin's initial experience in Philadelphia is a testament to the challenges faced by many immigrants arriving in the colonies, capturing the psychological and practical transition from destitution to hopefulness as he navigated the city, marking the beginning of his journey towards realizing the "American Dream." His encounter with Deborah Read, his future wife, serves as a poignant illustration of his humble origins and the potential for upward mobility in the new world.

   - 菲莉斯·惠特利（Phillis Wheatley, c.1753-1784）是首位出版诗集的非洲裔美国人，她的生活经历十分独特且具有历史意义。作为奴隶出生，她在1767年通过《纽波特水星报》首次发表诗歌，她的第一本诗集《宗教和道德各种主题的诗》在1773年于伦敦出版，这一事件不仅反映了她个人的文学才华，也对后来的废奴运动产生了深远的影响，因为她证明了奴隶同样具有高尚的精神和智力。

   - 《野金银花》的语气既带有哀婉又富含哲理，它展现出诗人对于短暂事物之美及其背后深刻寓意的深深感慨
1. **Memorization:**
   - Philip Freneau (1752-1832) was one of the most significant American poets of the 18th century, earning the title "Poet of the American Revolution." Freneau's masterpiece, "The Wild Honey Suckle," exemplifies the artistic heights of his lyric poetry and appears in his 1786 collection titled "Poems by Philip Freneau."

   - Phillis Wheatley (c.1753-1784) was the first African American to publish a book of poetry, with a life story that is both unique and historically significant. Born into slavery, she first published her poems in the Newport Mercury in 1767, and her debut volume, "Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral," was released in London in 1773. This event not only demonstrated her individual literary prowess but also had profound implications for the subsequent abolitionist movement, as it proved that slaves possessed equally noble spirits and intellect.

2. **Comprehension:**
   - "The Wild Honey Suckle" revolves around philosophical musings on natural beauty and the transience of life, employing personification to imbue natural scenes with life and emotion, evoking a sense of serenity, awe, and the treasuring of what is fleeting.
   - The second selection ("A Hymn to the Morning") celebrates the arrival of a new day and affirms the vitality of life, anticipating a bright future. It may employ classical allusions to convey an aesthetic rooted in antiquity, emphasizing the hope and renewal brought by dawn.
   - "The Wild Honey Suckle" and "A Hymn to the Morning" exhibit distinct rhythmic qualities; the former leans toward introspection and lyricism, while the latter likely showcases a more upbeat, optimistic outlook on life and a lively tempo.

3. **Application:**
   - "The Wild Honey Suckle" poem portrays the beauty and change in nature, conveying the brevity and preciousness of life through vivid, nuanced metaphors that express the poet's profound perception and contemplation of existence.
   - The tone of "The Wild Honey Suckle" is simultaneously melancholic and philosophical, reflecting the poet's deep appreciation for the beauty of ephemeral things and the profound symbolism they embody.

In summary, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and James Russell Lowell, all of whom are associated with the Transcendentalist movement.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson** (1803-1882) was a significant figure in American thought and literature. Born in Boston, Emerson's journey included becoming a minister, European travels, and eventually publishing key works that shaped Transcendentalism. His major publications include "Nature" (1836), where he argues that solitary contemplation in nature fosters individual self-discovery and understanding of the universe's interconnectedness. The Transcendentalist movement, which Emerson spearheaded, posits that humans possess the ability to transcend mere sensory experience to grasp deeper truths about existence and the divine.

**Henry David Thoreau** (1817-1862) shared similar Transcendentalist beliefs. He famously lived in a cabin near Walden Pond, located two miles away from Concord, Massachusetts. His most celebrated work, titled "Walden; or, Life in the Woods" (1854), documents his experiment in simple living and self-reliance during his two-year stay at Walden Pond. Thoreau's decision to reside there reflects his desire to escape societal conformity and discover his authentic self through direct contact with nature, aligning with Transcendentalist principles.

**James Russell Lowell** (1819-1891), while not solely defined by Transcendentalism, contributed significantly to American literature. His writings often explored the aesthetics of nature and human experience. Lowell's piece "A Good Word for Winter" compares winter favorably to other seasons using rich imagery and metaphorical language. He appreciated winter for its honesty and lack of pretense, suggesting that engaging with winter requires a direct confrontation with reality, much like the essence of Transcendentalist thought.

Regarding **application**:

1. Summarizing select passages: 
   - Emerson's "Nature" emphasizes the importance of solitude and reflection in nature for personal growth and self-realization.
   - Thoreau's "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For" from "Walden" details his reasons for choosing to live in solitude at Walden Pond, demonstrating a life lived intentionally and according to his belief in simplicity and deep engagement with nature.
   - Lowell's text lauds winter as a season that demands genuine interaction without melodrama or sentimentality, presenting it as a refreshing and honest companion.

2. Understanding Transcendentalism from "Nature": Emerson’s essay proposes that the natural world serves as a mirror to reflect our inner selves and universal truths. By contemplating nature, individuals can access the divine and reach a higher level of consciousness beyond empirical observation.

3. Thoreau's lifestyle at Walden Pond resonates with Transcendentalism because his pursuit of simplicity and communion with nature allowed him to embody the philosophy's core values, advocating for individual freedom, self-reliance, and spiritual awakening through close observation and engagement with the environment.

4. Lowell's affinity for winter seems to stem from its inherent qualities of authenticity and straightforwardness, which align with a Transcendentalist appreciation for truth and direct experience. While not explicitly stated, Lowell may appreciate winter for its capacity to strip away distractions and encourage introspection akin to the Transcendentalist quest for spiritual enlightenment. 

Additionally, each author uses vivid language and imagery to convey their ideas, reflecting the rich literary tradition and symbolic depth characteristic of Transcendentalist literature.

**Comprehension:**

1. **Emerson, Thoreau, and Lowell's Lives and Works**: Emerson, a central figure in Transcendentalism, promoted the idea that true knowledge transcends sensory experience and is gained through intuition and direct connection with the natural world. His seminal work "Nature" encapsulates this philosophy, encouraging readers to seek an "original relation to the universe." Thoreau, influenced by Emerson's teachings, practiced Transcendentalism in his daily life, evidenced by his time spent living at Walden Pond. His work "Walden; or, Life in the Woods" underscores his advocacy for a simple, self-reliant existence harmonious with nature. Lowell, though not strictly a Transcendentalist, was a celebrated writer whose "A Good Word for Winter" shows his appreciation for the raw and unadorned aspects of nature, comparing winter favorably to other seasons due to its honesty and lack of affectation.

2. **Transcendentalism Defined**: Transcendentalism, as outlined by Emerson, posits that there exists a fundamental unity in the universe, and individuals can access this unity through intuition rather than empirical evidence alone. It promotes the belief in inherent goodness in humanity and nature, encouraging self-reliance and the rejection of societal conformities. The movement also advocates for finding spiritual truth directly in nature, bypassing traditional religious institutions.

3. **Location of Walden Pond**: Walden Pond is situated approximately two miles from Concord, Massachusetts, and holds historical significance as the location where Thoreau conducted his experiment in simple living detailed in his book "Walden."

4. **Chapter Subtitle in "Walden"**: The specific chapter excerpt mentioned in the text corresponds to the section titled "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For," where Thoreau explains his motivations for moving to the woods and embracing a solitary life at Walden Pond.

5. **Themes and Language Styles**: Emerson's "Nature" exhibits a baroque, epigrammatic style, weaving together complex ideas with concise expressions that embody the essence of Transcendental thought. Thoreau's "Walden" is characterized by a reflective and practical tone, chronicling his experiences in the woods to illustrate his ideas on the virtues of simplicity, self-sufficiency, and the importance of being attuned to nature's rhythms. Lowell's description of winter captures the season's honest character through rich imagery and figurative language, contrasting it with the more emotional and changeable personas of the other seasons.

In application:

- **Summarizing Passages**: Each author presents unique perspectives on the relationship between humanity and nature, emphasizing personal development, self-awareness, and a return to fundamental truths through immersion in natural settings.

- **Understanding Transcendentalism**: Through "Nature," one grasps the core Transcendentalist principle that the deepest truths lie beyond physical appearances, accessible via intuitive insight fostered by communing with the natural world.

- **Thoreau's Views and Transcendentalism**: Thoreau's choice to live at Walden Pond represents a tangible manifestation of Transcendental ideals, as he sought to live deliberately and without unnecessary societal constraints, allowing for a pure and direct encounter with the spiritual and moral lessons found in nature.

- **Lowell's Affinity for Winter**: Lowell appreciates winter for its unfussy honesty and its ability to bring individuals back to their essential humanity, traits that resonate with Transcendental values that prize authenticity and self-exploration without reliance on external validations or artificial constructs.

In summary:

1. **Biographical and Literary Highlights**:
   - **William Cullen Bryant**: An influential American poet born in 1794, Bryant was known for bridging Romantic themes with classical forms. His notable works include "Thanatopsis" and "To a Waterfowl," the latter inspired by his encounter with a waterfowl at age 21, which encapsulates universal themes of guidance and purpose amidst life's uncertainties. Bryant published his first book of poetry, "Poems," in 1821.

   - **Henry Wadsworth Longfellow**: Born in 1807, Longfellow was an accomplished poet whose work resonated widely during his lifetime. He authored "A Psalm of Life," emphasizing the importance of living a meaningful existence, and "The Slave's Dream," which poignantly reflects on the plight of slaves, although he himself did not experience slavery firsthand. Longfellow held a prestigious place in American literature as one of the most popular living poets of his era, second only to Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson.

   - **Walt Whitman**: Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" was initially self-published in 1855 with twelve poems, and by the final edition in 1891-1892, it grew to encompass approximately 400 poems. Known for pioneering free verse, Whitman broke away from traditional poetic structures, capturing the spirit of a burgeoning American individualism and the essence of the nation's character in his work.

   - **Emily Dickinson**: With nearly 1800 poems penned during her lifetime, Dickinson gained posthumous acclaim as a seminal American poet alongside Longfellow and Whitman. Her poems often lacked titles and adhered to unconventional styles, characterized by broken meter and dashes, with themes ranging from the contemplation of death to the joy of nature. Her poem "Success" offers a didactic perspective on the true understanding of success and the value of living a fulfilling life.

2. **Understanding Themes and Artistic Features**:
   - In "To a Waterfowl," the regulated verse rhythms serve to underscore the message of divine providence and the constancy of purpose, offering comfort and assurance to the reader.
   - "A Psalm of Life" delivers a didactic message to young men, encouraging them to live sublimely despite the certainty of death, reflecting Longfellow's intent to inspire and guide.
   - "The Slave's Dream" contrasts the beauty of a peaceful escape from suffering with the grim reality of slavery, evoking a sense of tragedy and sympathy in the reader.
   - Whitman's "Song of Myself" exemplifies his innovative free verse, allowing for fluid expression of his expansive themes and the persona of a prophetic voice commenting on the human condition and the emerging American identity.
   - Dickinson's unique poetic form, combined with her use of unconventional punctuation and capitalization, showcases her profound intellect and the range of emotions conveyed in her works, such as "Success" where she explores the paradoxical aspects of fame versus anonymity.

3. **Application Examples**:
   - Summarizing thematic content and artistic qualities of the featured poems could involve discussing how Bryant uses nature imagery to impart wisdom and comfort, Longfellow’s ability to create empathetic responses through contrasting beauty and suffering, Whitman's revolutionary approach to poetry in celebrating the interconnectedness of all life, and Dickinson's concise yet deeply layered reflections on personal achievement and societal expectations.

   - Regarding the structured verse of "To a Waterfowl," the regular rhythm serves to reinforce the idea of a consistent path guided by a higher power, providing a sense of stability and direction in the face of life's challenges.

   - In relation to Dickinson's poems "Success" and "I," a reflection on success might consider the balance between seeking personal fulfillment and avoiding the pitfalls of societal recognition or fame, suggesting that genuine happiness lies in finding contentment in the ordinary and anonymous aspects of life.

In summary:

Washington Irving (1783-1859) was an influential figure in American literature, best known for his works such as "Rip Van Winkle" (1819) and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" (1820). Irving's unique blend of humor, satire, and romantic nostalgia established him as a pioneering figure in early American literature and helped shape the nation's literary identity.

Mark Twain, born Samuel Clemens in 1835 and passing away in 1910, authored the highly successful novel "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" in 1884. The novel's realistic portrayal of the American South, particularly through the voice and perspective of Huck, demonstrated a groundbreaking use of African American vernacular English, which contributed to its enduring appeal and influence. Notably, Ernest Hemingway famously praised it by stating that "all modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called 'Huckleberry Finn.'"

Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) is recognized for his profound exploration of moral complexity and sin in "The Scarlet Letter" (1850). Unlike the Transcendentalists' optimistic outlook, Hawthorne delved into the darker aspects of human nature and the rigid Puritanical society of New England. In the novel, the scarlet letter 'A' worn by Hester Prynne symbolizes shame and serves as a vehicle to critique societal hypocrisy.

Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is celebrated for his contributions to the development of the short story genre, particularly his mastery of suspense, irony, and the macabre. His tales, such as "The Cask of Amontillado" (1846), are characterized by intricate plotting, psychological depth, and poetic language. Poe's ability to create a haunting atmosphere and his focus on themes like despair and retribution left a lasting impact on American literature.

Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) wrote the powerful anti-slavery novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly" (1852), which depicted the horrors of slavery and the emotional toll it exacted on both slaves and slaveholders. The novel's immense popularity fueled abolitionist sentiment and is often cited as a contributing factor to the tensions leading up to the American Civil War.

Regarding the specific textual analyses:
- In Washington Irving's "Rip Van Winkle," the protagonist's comedic escapades serve as a gentle satire of human idleness and societal change.
- Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" uses colloquial African American dialect to imbue the narrative with a sense of reality and to satirize racial attitudes prevalent at the time.
- Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter" employs elaborate sentences in describing Hester Prynne to explore the complexities of morality and the oppressive effects of societal judgment.
- Edgar Allan Poe's "The Cask of Amontillado" exhibits his signature style of terror and dramatic irony, employing vivid imagery to condemn the cruelty of slavery and human depravity.
- Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin" features poignant passages where the character Uncle Tom suffers, embodying the plight of enslaved individuals and highlighting the emotional power of her prose to evoke sympathy for the abolitionist cause.

In application:
- The essential content of the selected texts varies greatly, from Irving's light-hearted yet insightful commentary on human nature to Twain's piercing social critique via Huck's adventures, Hawthorne's grim moral drama set in Puritan New England, Poe's chilling horror tale revealing the depths of revenge, and Stowe's emotionally charged account of the evils of slavery.
- The depiction of Widow Watson in "Tom Sawyer" can be seen as a subtle, humorous critique of the strictures and hypocrisies of adult society as perceived by a childlike narrator.
- Comparatively, the narrative styles of "Rip Van Winkle" and "The Scarlet Letter" differ significantly, with Irving employing a whimsical and nostalgic tone, whereas Hawthorne's language is more formal and reflective of the moral gravity inherent in his subject matter.

**领会：**

1. **读懂本节所列必考选文，理解其主题和细节：**
   - **选篇2** (Huneker's *New York by Night*) explores the vibrant, diverse, and sometimes contradictory nature of the city at night, emphasizing the multicultural immigrant population, bustling nightlife, and the dazzling spectacle of the "Great White Way."
   - **选篇3** (James' *The Sky-Scrapers of New York*) presents James' ambivalent cultural attitude toward the skyscrapers, using hyperbolic descriptions and imagery to convey a sense of awe, disorientation, and unease with the rapid modernization and commercialization they symbolize.
   - **选篇4** (Wilson's *Life in Brooklyn in the Thirties*) portrays a bleak, dreamlike vision of Brooklyn's streets, reflecting the author's perception of the "vulgar" community's banality, hopelessness, and monotony.

2. **詹姆斯对美国天大楼的文化态度，夸张的描写手法和使用的主要意象：**
   - James exhibits a complex and ambivalent attitude towards the skyscrapers, admiring their grandeur as symbols of economic prowess while simultaneously expressing discomfort with their ostentatious novelty and perceived lack of cultural depth.
   - He employs exaggerated language and metaphor, likening the skyscrapers to "extravagant pins" piercing a large cushion, creating a jarring, chaotic image that conveys the overwhelming impact of these structures on the urban landscape.
   - Key motifs in James' portrayal include the "terrible things" representing societal change, the "multitudinous sky-scrapers" as symbols of wealth and pride, and the suggestion that these structures are mere placeholders until the next "word" of economic innovation emerges.

3. **选篇3,夜晚的纽约是如何显现出一个多元种族融合的欲望大都市的形象，作者：如何用典故象征来表达对纽约的矛盾情感：**
   - In *New York by Night*, Huneker paints a vivid portrait of New York as a melting pot of diverse cultures, with immigrants from various nations contributing to the energetic and sensuous atmosphere of the city after dark.
   - The author employs allusions and metaphors to express his mixed feelings about the city, such as comparing it to Dante's infernal city of Dis and describing the skyscrapers as "extravagant pins" in a luxurious cushion, suggesting both fascination with the city's dynamism and a critique of its superficiality and excess.

4. **詹姆斯的冷峻古典和亨内克形象生动的语言风格的比较：**
   - James' writing is characterized by a more formal, nuanced, and introspective tone, often utilizing intricate sentences and subtle psychological insights to convey a sense of the city's complexity and cultural tensions.
   - In contrast, Huneker's style is more colloquial, anecdotal, and effervescent, bursting with life and energy, as he captures the vibrant chaos of New York's nightlife in a manner that is immediate, impressionistic, and rich in sensory detail.

5. **威尔逊散点透视、松散句式所表现梦幻潜意识般的城市图景：**
   - Wilson's description of Brooklyn in the 1930s employs a scattered, impressionistic perspective that mirrors the dreamlike, subconscious quality of the city's atmosphere.
   - His use of loose sentence structure contributes to this effect, allowing thoughts and observations to flow freely and often unpredictably, evoking the fragmented, disconnected experience of navigating the city's desolate streets and encountering its disillusioned inhabitants.

In summary, the three authors—Huneker, James, and Wilson—each offer distinct perspectives on New York and its urban landscape, drawing on their individual styles, influences, and thematic interests to create unique, nuanced portrayals of the city's character, energy, and contradictions.

#### Poetry:

1. **Recall:**
   1. **Frost:** Born in 1874 and passing away in 1963, Robert Frost began his life in San Francisco before settling into a rural life after a brief stint at Harvard and an unsuccessful farming venture. He gained recognition with his first publication, "A Boy's Will" (1913), and solidified his reputation with "North of Boston" (1914). Frost won four Pulitzer Prizes for his poetry collections, including "New Hampshire" (1923), which contains the celebrated poems "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" and "The Road Not Taken." Frost is lauded for his portrayal as a simple, rural poet who upheld traditional metrics, structures, and themes during the height of modernism, while concealing underlying complexity and darkness in his seemingly plain style.
   2. **T.S. Eliot:** Thomas Stearns Eliot (1888-1965), hailing from a prominent New England family, spent his early life in St. Louis but always identified as a New Englander. After studying at Harvard and Oxford, he encountered Ezra Pound in England, who proved instrumental in launching Eliot's literary career. His landmark work, "The Waste Land" (1922), is a modernist masterpiece that grapples with themes of human alienation and the search for redemption in the aftermath of World War I. Characterized by its modernist poetic form, the employment of myth to mirror modern experiences, collage-like juxtapositions, and a focus on form as a carrier of meaning, it established Eliot as a leading figure of modernist poetry.
   3. **Hughes:** Langston Hughes (1902-1967) was raised by his mother and grandmother, who instilled in him stories of African American heroism. His passion for poetry, music, and art flourished during his youth, leading to the publication of "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" (1921). His first book of verse, "The Weary Blues" (1926), and subsequent collections, like "Fine Clothes to the Jew" (1927) and "Montage of a Dream Deferred" (1951), captured the joys, struggles, and evolving realities of African American life in Harlem. Hughes was a central figure of the Harlem Renaissance, using his poetry to celebrate black identity and culture, as seen in works like "My People."

2. **Comprehension:**
   1. The poems from Frost, such as "The Road Not Taken" and "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," offer profound reflections on life's choices and obligations, respectively, conveyed through their straightforward language and rural settings.
   2. Eliot's modernist poetry, exemplified by "The Waste Land," is marked by its fragmented structure, mythical allusions, and a collage of diverse voices, reflecting the disorientation and spiritual emptiness of the post-war world. The two selected segments from the poem vividly depict the rebirth of the land following a harsh winter and the squalor of modern urban life.
   3. The Harlem Renaissance, a cultural and intellectual movement centered in Harlem during the 1910s to 1930s, celebrated and promoted African American art, literature, and culture. Hughes played a pivotal role in this movement, using his poetry to articulate the dreams, struggles, and beauty of black people, as seen in works like "I Continue to Dream" and "My People," which employ vivid imagery and metaphor to convey hope, resilience, and pride.

3. **Application:**
   1. Frost's poems, such as "The Road Not Taken" and "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," explore themes of personal choice and responsibility, employing accessible language and rural imagery to convey deep philosophical insights. In contrast, Eliot's modernist poetry, as embodied in "The Waste Land," utilizes a fragmented structure, dense allusions, and a juxtaposition of multiple voices to convey the disillusionment and fragmentation of the post-war world.
   2. The two selected segments from "The Waste Land" symbolize the cyclical nature of life and death, as well as the stark contrast between the natural world's renewal and the moral decay of urban society. "I Continue to Dream" symbolizes the enduring power of hope and the importance of maintaining aspirations despite adversity, while "My People" employs rhetorical devices to celebrate the beauty and resilience of the African American community.
   3. In "The Waste Land," T. S. Eliot's "The Cruellest Month" section symbolizes the paradoxical pain of post-war regeneration, as spring's renewal awakens memories and desires that haunt individuals despite surface recovery. "Unreal City" portrays London as a dystopian metropolis, shrouded in fog and filled with disconnected masses, embodying modern society's spiritual emptiness, moral decay, and pervasive sense of death amidst material abundance.

In summary, Frost, T.S. Eliot, and Hughes represent distinct poetic voices and styles. Frost's poetry is characterized by its simplicity, rural themes, and exploration of universal human dilemmas, whereas Eliot's modernist works challenge traditional forms and delve into the complexities of the modern psyche. Hughes, a key figure of the Harlem Renaissance, celebrates African American identity and dreams, employing powerful imagery and symbolism to convey the richness and resilience of black culture.

#### (三) Novels:
1. **Recall:**
   1. **Defining Dreiser's Realism/Naturalism:** Theodore Dreiser's novels are characterized by a faithful (naturalistic) representation of reality, exposing and criticizing social problems in a capitalist society. He views social processes as scientific evolution and presents a deterministic struggle for survival. His works depict the conflict between the individual and society in a capitalist context, featuring bold characterizations, spare and lean style, and treating sex as a major force in human lives, challenging traditional moral norms.
   2. **"Lost Generation" Summary:** The "Lost Generation" refers to a group of disillusioned and alienated young people, mainly American writers and artists, who came of age during or shortly after World War I. Their experiences of war, societal upheaval, and cultural change led to feelings of disconnection, disillusionment, and a sense of aimlessness, often reflected in their works through themes of disillusionment, hedonism, and the search for meaning in a seemingly purposeless world.
   3. **American Frontier Concept:** The American frontier, or "frontier," refers to the expanding western boundary of European-American settlement, beyond which lay unsettled lands and indigenous populations. It symbolizes the edge of civilization, where the process of exploration, conquest, and assimilation of new territories took place, embodying the spirit of adventure, self-reliance, and the pursuit of opportunity.
   4. **Origins of the Civil War:** The American Civil War (1861-1865) was primarily rooted in the issue of slavery, economic differences between the agrarian South and industrializing North, states' rights versus federal authority, and differing visions for the nation's future growth and expansion. Tensions escalated over decades until secession of Southern states and the subsequent military conflict.

2. **Comprehension:**
   1. **Understanding Themes & Details in Excerpts:** Each excerpt presents a distinct theme and details relevant to its respective novel, showcasing the authors' unique perspectives on various aspects of American life and society.
   2. **Materialism & Moral Decay in _Sister Carrie_:** _Sister Carrie_ portrays the pervasive influence of materialism and the ruthless competition within society, leading to the erosion of traditional morality as characters pursue wealth and status at any cost.
   3. **"Lost Generation" Spirit in Selection 5:** The excerpt reflects the disillusionment, alienation, and existential questioning characteristic of the "Lost Generation," as the protagonist grapples with the harsh realities of life and the futility of his dreams.
   4. **London's Representation of Frontier Life:** Jack London anthropomorphizes sled dogs in _The Call of the Wild_ to convey the brutal realities of life on the American frontier during the Gold Rush, emphasizing the harshness of the natural environment and the struggle for survival.
   5. **Frontier Life in _My Ántonia_:** _My Ántonia_ vividly captures the lives of pioneers on the American Midwest prairie, depicting their resilience, hardships, and the deep bonds forged amidst the vast, untamed landscape.
   6. **Hemingway's "Hard-Boiled" Style in Selection 8:** Hemingway's distinctive style is evident in his concise, direct language, minimalism, and emphasis on action and dialogue. His "hard-boiled" approach eschews sentimentality, focusing on the stark realities of life, often with a stoic acceptance of adversity.
   7. **Faulkner's Depiction of Change in _A Rose for Emily_:** Faulkner employs vivid scene-setting and character development to illustrate the transition from the old order to modernity, with Emily Grierson representing the fading traditions and the younger generation embodying the encroaching change.

3. **Application:**
   1. **Summary of Featured Excerpts:**
      - _Sister Carrie_ (Dreiser): Chronicles the rise of a young woman in urban America, highlighting the allure of material success and the moral compromises it entails.
      - _The Old Man and the Sea_ (Hemingway): Depicts an aging fisherman's epic battle with a giant marlin, exploring themes of endurance, dignity, and the human condition.
      - _A Rose for Emily_ (Faulkner): Presents the enigmatic life of a reclusive Southern woman, revealing the decay of a bygone era and the clash between tradition and progress.
      - _Killing a Big Mako Shark_ (Hemingway): Shows the struggle between man and nature, encapsulating the harsh realities of the sea and the indomitable spirit of the protagonist.
      - _An Afternoon on the American Midwest Prairie_ (Cather): Recalls an idyllic afternoon spent by two friends on the prairie, evoking the beauty of the landscape and the innocence of childhood friendship.
      - _The Horrible Monument of a Bygone Age_ (Faulkner): Explores the decline of the old South through the life and death of Emily Grierson, a symbol of a vanished aristocracy.
      - _Graveyard Brooding over a Lost Generation_ (Fitzgerald): Portrays the disillusionment and moral decay of post-war America through the tragic story of a young businessman turned murderer.

   2. **Narrative Styles in _Carrie_ vs. _The Old Man and the Sea_:**
      - _Carrie_ (Dreiser) employs a detailed, realistic narrative style, delving into the psychological motivations and social contexts that shape its characters' lives. The language is descriptive, reflecting the complexity of societal forces and individual choices.
      - _The Old Man and the Sea_ (Hemingway) exhibits a spare, minimalist style, relying on concise sentences, direct action, and introspection. Hemingway's signature economy of words creates a taut, almost cinematic narrative, focusing on essential moments and emotions.

   3. **Irony in _A Rose for Emily_:**
      - _A Rose for Emily_ contains dramatic irony in the townspeople's perception of Emily as a "fallen monument" and their obliviousness to her dark secrets. The title itself is ironic, as the "rose" symbolizes love or respect, while Emily's actions reveal a twisted, morbid fixation. The story's climax, revealing Emily's macabre secret, underscores the gap between the genteel façade and the grotesque reality, offering a biting commentary on the decay of Southern aristocracy and the insular nature of small-town life.

In this section, we will provide a comprehensive overview of Arthur Miller's biography, the central themes and artistic techniques of his masterpiece "Death of a Salesman," the concept of the "American Dream" in its historical context, and a detailed analysis of the excerpted dramatic scene from Act II of the play.

### 1. Remembrance:

**(1)** Arthur Miller (1915-2005) was born in New York City. His family's financial collapse during the Great Depression of 1929 led them to relocate to Brooklyn, where Miller's formative years were shaped by the era's grim socioeconomic conditions. This backdrop inspired Miller to explore the intricate relationship between individuals, their work, and the sacrifices demanded for success. At the University of Michigan, Miller's plays garnered several accolades. His breakthrough came in 1947 with "All My Sons," which tells the tragic tale of Joe Keller, driven to suicide by guilt over deaths caused by his business failures. In 1949, "Death of a Salesman" solidified Miller's status as a prominent American playwright. Responding to the repressive political climate of the 1950s Cold War era and McCarthyism, Miller penned "The Crucible" (1953), a play that draws parallels between the 17th-century Salem witch trials and the hunt for Communists in the 1950s. According to Miller, "The Crucible" is his most frequently produced work both domestically and internationally.

**(2)** "Death of a Salesman" presents a poignant tragedy of a man, Willy Loman, who sacrifices or sells his life in pursuit of the "American Dream." Set in two acts and an epilogue, the play chronicles the disillusionment of traveling salesman Willy, who realizes his failures as a father and husband after years of relentless career pursuits. Both his sons, Happy and Biff, fail to achieve success. As Willy's professional fortunes decline, he retreats into vivid hallucinations, revisiting the past in search of the roots of his downfall. Unable to accept defeat, Willy coerces Biff into pursuing unrealistic business ventures, culminating in a heated confrontation that ends in Willy's suicide, leaving behind an insurance payout for his son. The play premiered on Broadway in 1949, enjoying a remarkable run of 742 performances and subsequent adaptations in television and theater, garnering international acclaim and recognition as a seminal work in American drama.

**(3)** The "American Dream" in the context of Miller's play refers to the idealized promise of upward mobility, financial prosperity, and personal fulfillment attainable through hard work, determination, and individual initiative. It embodies the notion that anyone, regardless of their social background, can achieve success and happiness in America if they diligently pursue their goals. However, the play exposes the darker side of this dream, revealing how its unattainability for many, coupled with societal pressure to conform to its expectations, can lead to personal devastation and the erosion of self-worth.

### 2. Understanding:

**(1)** The excerpt from Act II starkly depicts the shattering of the "American Dream" for the Loman family. Biff, in a heated argument with his father, asserts that they are not exceptional individuals but merely "a dime a dozen," both deluded by the false promises of success inherent in the American Dream. He identifies himself as a failure, attributing it to his lack of intelligence and popularity, and insists that he lacks the innate capacity for "making it." He contends that Willy's unyielding expectations have only ruined his life. This confrontation epitomizes the disillusionment and dashed hopes that characterize the demise of their shared dream.

**(2)** The personal pursuit of material success and social standing, as embodied by Willy, results in severe psychological distortion. Willy's persistent denial of reality, his desperate clinging to past glories, and his irrational belief in the formulaic nature of success contribute to a deep-seated sense of inadequacy and failure. His mental breakdown, manifested in vivid hallucinations and conversations with his deceased brother Ben, underscores the tragic consequences of a life built upon unsustainable aspirations.

**(3)** The pervasive atmosphere of tragedy in the excerpt is heightened by the characters' hallucinations, particularly Willy's interactions with the spectral figure of Ben. These surreal exchanges create a haunting, dreamlike quality that blurs the line between reality and fantasy, emphasizing the disintegration of Willy's psyche and the dissolution of his once-cherished dreams.

**(4)** The excerpt reveals complex emotional dynamics within the Loman family. The strained relationship between Willy and Biff is characterized by mutual disappointment, resentment, and a desperate longing for understanding and reconciliation. Despite their estrangement, Biff's emotional collapse at Willy's feet and Willy's subsequent elation at the revelation of Biff's enduring love, despite his financial failures and infidelity, demonstrate the profound bond that underlies their tumultuous interactions.

### 3. Application:

**(1)** In the excerpt, the characters exhibit distinct personalities, speech patterns, and relationships that fuel the dramatic conflict:

- **Willy Loman**: A delusional, aging salesman, Willy oscillates between grandiose reminiscences of his past and bitter recriminations against those he perceives as having wronged him. His speech is marked by contradictions, repetitions, and frequent shifts between past and present, reflecting his fragmented mental state. His relationship with Biff is fraught with tension, stemming from Willy's unrealistic expectations and Biff's inability to meet them.

- **Biff Loman**: Once a promising athlete, Biff is now a disillusioned drifter struggling to find his place in the world. He speaks with a mixture of anger, frustration, and self-loathing, openly acknowledging his failures and rejecting the superficial values that have guided his father's life. His interactions with Willy are characterized by a deep-seated desire for acceptance and understanding, yet they are punctuated by explosive confrontations fueled by years of pent-up emotions.

- **Linda Loman**: Although not directly featured in the excerpt, Linda's presence is felt through her concern for Willy's well-being and her attempts to maintain familial harmony. Her relationship with Willy is one of unwavering loyalty, despite her awareness of his flaws and the family's deteriorating circumstances.

The primary conflict arises from the clash between Willy's stubborn adherence to a distorted version of the American Dream and Biff's rejection of it, leading to a devastating confrontation that exposes the hollowness of their aspirations and the depth of their emotional wounds.

**(2)** The characters' contrasting mindsets are evident:

- **Willy**: Gripped by a desperate need to prove his worth and secure his legacy, Willy is unable to accept his own and his sons' failures. He clings to a distorted vision of success, fueled by nostalgia, pride, and an intense fear of being forgotten. His deteriorating mental health is evidenced by his hallucinations and his growing detachment from reality.

- **Biff**: Having experienced a profound disillusionment with the materialistic values that have defined his father's life, Biff grapples with feelings of inadequacy and a search for authenticity. He is tormented by his inability to live up to Willy's expectations and the realization that the American Dream they both pursued is illusory. His emotional outpouring at the end of the scene reflects a cathartic release of pent-up frustration and a longing for genuine connection with his father.

**(3)** The戏剧语言特色 of the excerpt include:

- **Stream-of-consciousness monologues**: Willy's rambling thoughts and memories, often triggered by everyday objects or events, provide a window into his disordered mind and reveal the extent to which his past haunts his present.

- **Flashbacks and non-linear narrative**: The seamless integration of past events into the present action enhances the dreamlike quality of the play and underscores the characters' inability to escape their histories.

- **Symbolism**: Objects such as the rubber hose (symbolizing Willy's contemplation of suicide) and the seeds (representing Willy's futile attempts at creating a tangible legacy) add layers of meaning and reinforce the play's themes.

- **Poetic and colloquial language**: Miller skillfully blends elevated, almost poetic language with conversational idioms, capturing the characters' emotional intensity while maintaining an authentic sense of their everyday lives.

In summary, the excerpt from Act II of "Death of a Salesman" powerfully illustrates the disillusionment and decay of the American Dream, the psychological toll of unfulfilled material ambitions, and the complex web of emotions binding the Loman family together. Through its richly layered characters, evocative language, and innovative dramatic techniques, Miller crafts a haunting portrait of a man and a society grappling with the harsh realities beneath the glittering facade of the American Dream.
