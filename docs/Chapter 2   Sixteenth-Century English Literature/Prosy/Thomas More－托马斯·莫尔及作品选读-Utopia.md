St.Thomas More又作**Sir Thomas More**，托马斯·莫尔，(1478年2月7日-1535年7月6日)，欧洲早期空想社会主义学说的创始人，才华横溢的人文主义学者和阅历丰富的政治家，以其名著《乌托邦》而名垂史册。

托马斯·莫尔于出生在英国伦敦一个不太显赫的富有家庭。莫尔幼年丧母，由父亲带大。他的父亲约翰·莫尔(John More)曾担任过皇家高等法院的法官，是一位勤俭持家、正直明达的人，对儿子要求极为严格，这对莫尔一生产生了深刻的影响。

在当时的欧洲，拉丁文被视为进入上层社会的通行证。因此，幼小的莫尔被送入了伦敦的圣安冬尼学校，学习拉丁文。十三岁时，父亲将他寄住在坎特布雷大主教、红衣大主教莫顿(Morton)的家中作少年侍卫。莫顿是当时一位很有影响的政治家，他学识渊博、机智过人、谈吐优雅，曾担任过英国的大法官，对此莫尔在《乌托邦》中专门做过描述。从他那儿莫尔得到了很多有益的影响。

托马斯·莫尔曾当过律师、国会议员、财政副大臣、国会下院议长、大法官。1535年因反对亨利八世([就是那个有六任妻子的亨八](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247507834&idx=1&sn=aa7375fec4e12eb886c85de0e2fdccf9&scene=21#wechat_redirect))兼任教会首脑而被处死。

1886年，在莫尔去世三百多年后，被罗马天主教会的教宗庇护十一世册封为圣人，在1980年与主教费舍尔一起被教宗若望保禄二世尊为殉教圣人。

  

  

Sir Thomas More (1478-1535), an English **lawyer, humanist writer and politician**, was educatedat St Antony's School, London, and at Canterbury College, Oxford. He devoted his leisure to literature, becoming intimate with some famed humanists of the time, such as Colet, Lily, and, in 1499, Erasmus. 

He became master of requests and privy counsellor in 1517. More completed his _**Dialogue**_, **his first controversial book in English** in 1528. He succeeded Wolsey as Lord Chancellor in 1529 but resigned in 1532. 

After that, More lived for some time in retirement. Although willing to swear fidelity to the new Act of Succession, More refused to take any oath that should deny the pope's authority. He also offended the English monarch by his denial of the king's divorce from Queen Catherine. 

Eventually, More was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London, indicted of high treason, found guilty, and beheaded in 1535. His English works were collected in 1557. His Latin publications (collected 1563, etc.) included, besides the famous _**Utopia**_ (1516)**《乌托邦》**, four dialogues and controversial tracts in divinity. More was canonized in 1935 by the Church of Rome.

  

This selection, taken from More's _Utopia_, his most famous and controversial work, **is often considered the highlight of More's attack on the evil of early capitalism in England**. 

More's pithiest attack on the English Enclosure Movement is perhaps in such proverbial phrases as **"Sheep are eating men" or "Sheep devour men", which metaphorically expresses the nature of capitalist expansion and suffering of the people at the beginning of the sixteenth century**. Originally written in Latin, _Utopia_ is set in a dialogical最初是用拉丁语写成的，以对话的形式出现 form and was widely read, and in 1551 it.

  

【Selected Text】

_The Capitalist Evil: Sheep Devour Men_

资本主义的罪恶：“羊吃人”

"But I do not think that this necessity of stealing arises only from hence; there is anothercause of it, more peculiar to England."

"What is that?" said the Cardinal.

"The increase of pasture," said I, "by which your sheep, which are naturally mild, and easily kept in order, may be said now to devour men and unpeople1, not only villages, but towns; for wherever it is found that the sheep of any soil yield a softer and richer wool than ordinary, there the nobility and gentry, and even those holy men, the abbots, not contented with the old rents which their farms yielded, nor thinking it enough that they, living at their ease, do no good to the public, resolve to do it hurt instead of good. They stop the course of agriculture, destroying houses and towns, reserving only the churches, and enclose grounds that they may lodge their sheep in them. As if forests and parks had swallowed up2 too little of the land, those worthy countrymen turn the best inhabited places into solitudes3 这些有钱的英国人吞并了树林和空地，不过他们似乎觉得这远远不够，于是又把那些人气最旺的居住地变成了荒无人烟之地; for when an insatiable wretch4, who is a plague to his country, resolves to enclose many thousand acres of ground, the owners, as well as tenants, are turned out of their possessions by trick or by main force, or, being wearied out by ill usage5, they are forced to sell them; by which means those miserable people, both men and women, married and unmarried, old and young, with their poor but numerous families (since country business requires many hands), are all forced to change their seats6, not knowing whither to go; and they must sell, almost for nothing, their household stuff, which could not bring them much money, even though they might stay for7 a buyer. When that little money is at an end (for it will be soon spent), what is left for them to do but either to steal, and so to be hanged (God knows how justly!), or to go about and beg? And if they do this they are put in prison as idle vagabonds, while they would willingly work but can find none that will hire them; for there is no more occasion for country labour, to which they have been bred, when there is no arable ground left. One shepherd can look after a flock, which will stock an extent of ground that would require many hands if it were to be ploughed and reaped 一个牧羊人占一块地就可以放牧一群羊；同样这块地，如果用于耕种农作物，则需要很多人手. This, likewise, in many places raises the price of corn. The price of wool is also so risen that the poor people, who were wont to8 make cloth, are no more able to buy it; and this, likewise, makes many of them idle: for since the increase of pasture God has punished the avarice of the owners by a rot among the sheep, which has destroyed vast numbers of them-to us it might have seemed more just had it fell on the owners themselves. But, suppose the sheep should increase ever so much, their price is not likely to fall; since, though they cannot be called a monopoly, because they are not engrossed by one person, yet they are in so few hands, and these are so rich, that, as they are not pressed to sell them sooner than they have a mind to it, so they never do it till they have raised the price as high as possible.

(from _Utopia_)

英国的封建制度确立于征服者威廉时期，经过几个世纪的发展，英国封建社会到14至15世纪已进入解体时期。

在这几百年的历史进程中，封建生产方式占据主导地位，支配全部的社会生活。在以小农耕作经营为基础的庄园制度下，每个庄园的土地可以分成三个部分，即由农民耕种的领主直领地、农民份地、公共森林和牧场。

公共牧场供夏季放牧牲畜，耕地和草地在收割后也辟为牧场，照例供众人使用，这种半公有式的“敞地制”实质是一种封建制度掩盖下保持下来的古代日耳曼制度。

从耕作方法上来看，庄园里推行一种适应庄园条田的三圃或三圃轮耕制。在敞田制的轮耕制下，何时耕种与收获，何时可以在收割后的田地上放牧牲畜，彼此要采取集体行动，这种习俗是日尔曼保存下来的古代农村土地公有制的残余。

随着封建私有制的发展，这种生产经营方式日益成为束缚生产力发展的因素。

英国在1235年的《默顿条例》和1285年的《第二威敏斯特条例》中已经授权庄园领主圈占自由佃户不需要的荒地。

[**爱德华三世时期**](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkzNjE5MzIxNg==&mid=2247507315&idx=1&sn=9f41b6b9f9943c81da2dc51bb484e922&chksm=c2a0e0dcf5d769ca59113c246713fdfbf57f060e540ba36c51a767dea0a956bab5861a91c470&scene=21#wechat_redirect)(1327-1377年)，羊毛及羊毛收入成为英王对法进行百年战争的重要物质保证。1421年，羊毛税的收入占全部税收的74%。羊毛成为英国政府收入的主要来源并且远销意大利被制作成呢绒制品。

到16世纪，受毛纺织业快速发展和羊毛产品市场发达、物价上涨等因素影响，使得一些逐利的英国贵族和资产阶级强行将耕地变为牧场，引起了很严重的社会问题，并且遭到了王室的反对。到了18至19世纪，圈地运动因得到政府的直接支持，逐渐达到高潮，这一时期被称为“议会圈地”时期，被圈占的土地达到了英格兰总面积的20％。[4]  

圈地运动改变了土地财产权，改变了土地使用和耕作方式、村庄布局以及农民的生活方式。很多失地农民因此进入城镇成为劳动力，使劳动者与其劳动条件的所有权分离，为资本主义生产方式的形成奠定了基础。



“但是我不认为盗窃率上升的原因仅有这一个。而且，另一个原因对英国而言更为奇特。”
“‘那是什么？’红衣主教问道。
“‘牧场的增多，’我说，‘绵羊本来是温驯的，所欲无多，现在却变得凶狠贪婪，甚至要把人吃掉，还要踏平我们的田野、住宅和城镇。无论在哪里，只要是能出产更柔软、更细腻的羊毛的地方，就有不满足于他们原有农场收益租金的贵族和乡绅，以及那些神职人员和住持们。他们不仅对国家没有任何贡献，而且过着安逸的生活，却还觉得不够，还坚决要造成更严重的危害。他们阻止农业发展，摧毁房屋和城市，仅仅保留教堂以及圈地养羊。仿佛森林和公园占用的土地太少，这些家伙让最适宜居住的地方都变成了荒僻之地。因为一个贪得无厌的家伙想要圈划数千英亩的土地，佃户就被用诡计或者暴力掠夺了所有的财产，还有的佃户在遭受不公平对待之后被迫变卖一切。这些悲惨的人们，无论男人女人、已婚未婚、年轻年老都要带着他们一贫如洗的家庭离开家乡，不知道去往何处。并且他们必须卖掉所有家当，这些东西本来就没什么价值，着急出手就更得不到几个钱。他们很快用完这点儿钱后，等待他们的就只有去盗窃而被处以绞刑（上帝知道这多么公正！）或者去乞讨？如果他们去乞讨，他们将因为流浪被关进监狱，其实他们乐意工作，却找不到愿意雇他们的人。没有可耕种的土地的时候，就不需要从事农业生产的人了。原本需要一众人耕种的土地现在用于养羊，一群羊只需要一个牧羊人照看就足够了。
“‘这也导致了很多地区谷物价格上涨。羊毛价格昂贵，穷人一向买不起它，也出现了滞销；牧场扩大之后，羊群里爆发了一场瘟疫，大量的羊因此死去，但作为对贪婪的惩罚，似乎把罪加在羊的主人身上更加合理。
“‘但是即使羊的数量增加了这么多，它的价格也不太可能下跌。因为，这虽然不能被称为垄断行业，由于从业者不止一人，但也是寡头经营，并且寡头们如此富有，所以他们不着急卖，直到价格足够高他们才会出售。
