**John Lyly** 约翰·李利(1554-1606)，伊丽莎白时代“大学才子派”的戏剧家，著名散文小说家。在24 岁时以散文小说《尤菲绮斯》扬名，1580 年又出版了续集《尤菲绮斯和他的英格兰》。

李利是“大学才子派”中最年长的，他的喜剧多半以古代神话和古代文学为题材，以田园大自然为背景，用典雅的散文写爱情故事。

李利的传奇与中世纪幻想传奇有区别，他刻画了当代生活。但是他着力于语言风俗，创造了被称为“尤菲绮斯体”的特殊的文体，在用词上大量使用直喻、隐喻、拟人、对仗、双声等手段，追求绚烂绮丽的效果。在句法上，作者将从句或短语骈化，类似中国六朝的骈体文。传奇中大量引用来自神话、古希腊罗马名人轶事的典故、谚语，使用双关语、俏皮话，极力堆砌。

这种文体在宫廷贵族间盛行，作家中也有不少人进行模仿。锡德尼并不嘉许这种文体，但他的《阿卡狄亚》文笔也有些“尤菲绮斯”色彩。

**John Lyly** (?1554-1606) was an Elizabethan courtier, poet and playwright best known for his pair of prose romances, **_Euphues_: _The Anatomy of Wit_** (1578)**《尤菲绮斯》** and its sequel **_Euphues and His England_**(1580)**《尤菲绮斯和他的英格兰》**. 

Lyly was one of the well-educated graduates known as "University Wits". He was educated at the King's School, Canterbury, then at Magdalen College, Oxford; he also studied at Cambridge. 

Lyly's peculiar style came to be known as "**euphuism**"尤菲绮斯体, which is **a peculiar style of English prose**. This highly mannered style is ornamental and sophisticated, **employing a deliberate excess of literary devices such as antitheses, alliterations, repetitions and rhetorical questions** 对偶、头韵、重复和正问. Classical learning and remote knowledge of all kinds are displayed. 

Euphuism was fashionable in the 1580s, especially in the Elizabethan court, and was imitated by writers of the 1580s and 90s, including Shakespeare. 

Although **_Euphues_** was Lyly's most popular and influential work in the Elizabethan period, his plays are also now **admired for their flexible use of dramatic prose and the elegant patterning of their construction**.

  

The following passage is from Lyly's **_Euphues and His England_**, which is representative of his famous "euphuism". 

In the passage, readers may find good examples of this rhetoric style characterized by excessive wordiness and periphrasis. And they may particularly be impressed by obsessively balanced, often antithetical phrases of the same length, linked by alliteration and joined into a baroque network in successive sentences. Such excessive interest in the form may make the reader feel that what has been talked about in the passage is, after all, not seriously true, for the form itself is foregrounded to express a satirical undertone.

Advice to a Foreign Visitor to England

At thy coming into England be not too inquisitive of1 news, neither curious in matters of State2, in assemblies ask no questions, either concerning manners or men3 君既来到英格兰之邦，切不可好奇心太重。街谈巷议，国家大事，都必不不必过问。人群聚集之处，不论说到风俗习惯还是风云人物，亦切莫开口探问. Be not lavish of thy tongue4, either in causes of weight5, lest thou6 show thyself an espial7, or in wanton talk8, lest hou prove thyself a fool. It is the nature of that country to sift? strangers: everyone that shakes thee10 by the hand, is not joined to thee in heart. They think Italians wanton, and Grecians subtle, they will trust neither, they are so incredulous, but undermine both, they are so wise. Be not querulous for every light occasion: they are impatient in their anger of any equal, ready to revenge an injury, but never wont to11 proffer any: they never fight without provoking, and once provoked they never cease. Beware thou fall not into the snares of love, the women there are wise, the men crafty: they will gather love by thy looks, and pick thy mind out of thy hands. It shall be there better to hear what they say, than to speak what thou think. They have long ears and short tongues, quick to hear, and slow to utter, broad eyes and light fingers12, ready to espy and apt to strike 他们耳朵长，舌头短，听觉敏锐，口头迟钝；他们眼观四路，手指发痒，到处窥视，动辄出手. Every stranger is a mark for them to shoot at: yet this must I say which in no countryI can tell the like, that it is as seldom to see a stranger abused there, as it is rare to see any well used elsewhere 不过，这个国家与其他任何国家都不一样，我们还得为它说句公道话：在这个地方，很少看到外人受到虐待，也正如此在其他任何地方很少看到外邦人说的款待一样. Yet presume not too much of the courtesies of those, for they differ in natures, some are hot, some cold, one simple, another wily; yet if thou use few words and fair speeches, thou shalt command anything thou stand in need of.

(from **_Euphues and His England_**)

16世纪，英国人文主义文学进入繁盛期，尤以戏剧成就最为突出。在莎士比亚之前，出现了一批所谓“大学才子”的剧作家。**“大学才子”剧作家**是16世纪后期在英国出现的一批人文主义剧作家，他们大都受过大学教育，具有人文主义思想，学识渊博，在戏剧创作上颇有创新。代表人物有**李利、马洛**等，他们**为莎士比亚戏剧的产生奠定了基础**。可以说，在他们的努力下，剧本写作、舞台演出、观众群都已成熟。

“大学才子派”中出现最早的是剑桥大学毕业生**约翰・李利**(1554-1606)、罗伯特・格林(1558-1592)，年龄最小贡献最大的是马洛(1564-1593)，他被看做是莎士比亚的先驱。

《尤菲绮斯》的故事很简单，年青富有的雅典人尤菲绮斯来到那不勒斯，不听年老的智者的劝告，放纵享受，爱上了朋友菲劳斯特的爱人露西亚。喜新厌旧的露西亚不久便另结新欢。尤菲绮斯重返雅典，埋首书本之中。作者借这个故事，谈论了爱情、教育、信仰、道德、习俗等问题。

著名的戏剧家莎士比亚也受其影响，莎士比亚早期的喜剧《爱的徒劳》嘲笑中世纪禁欲主义，肯定爱情的威力和价值，创作受李利的“尤菲绮斯体”影响，宫廷气氛浓，一般认为这是莎士比亚喜剧​中最弱的一部。

给英格兰外国访客的建议

At thy coming into England be not too inquisitive of news, neither curious in matters of State, in assemblies ask no questions, either concerning manners or men.
你一来到英格兰,切不可对时事新闻过于好奇探询,对国家大事也不要过问。在人群聚集之处,无论是谈及风俗习惯,还是谈及名人人物,都不要多嘴打听。

Be not lavish of thy tongue, either in causes of weight, lest thou show thyself an espial, or in wanton talk, lest thou prove thyself a fool.
无论是重大事务还是轻佻闲谈,都不要肆意多舌,免得暴露自己是窥探者,或被视为愚蠢之人。

It is the nature of that country to sift strangers: everyone that shakes thee by the hand, is not joined to thee in heart.
那个国家的天性就是对外来者严格审查:虽与你亲热握手,但心与你未必相连。

They think Italians wanton, and Grecians subtle, they will trust neither, they are so incredulous, but undermine both, they are so wise.
他们认为意大利人放荡,希腊人狡猾,因此既不相信前者,也怀疑后者,他们如此精明,对双方都防范有加。

Be not querulous for every light occasion: they are impatient in their anger of any equal, ready to revenge an injury, but never wont to proffer any: they never fight without provoking, and once provoked they never cease.
切不可因小事而爱发牢骚:他们对同阶层的人一怒就发,伺机报复,但从不主动挑衅。他们绝不会无故动手,但一旦被激怒就很难平息。

Beware thou fall not into the snares of love, the women there are wise, the men crafty: they will gather love by thy looks, and pick thy mind out of thy hands.
当心不要陷入爱情的陷阱,那里的女人精明能干,男人狡猾多计:他们会从你的眼神中窥探你的爱意,从你的手势中捕捉你的心思。

It shall be there better to hear what they say, than to speak what thou think.
在那里,倾听他人言论要远胜于你自己说教。  

They have long ears and light fingers, ready to espy and apt to strike.
他们耳朵长,手指利,到处窥探,动手敏捷。

Every stranger is a mark for them to shoot at: yet this must I say which in no country I can tell the like, that it is as seldom to see a stranger abused there, as it is rare to see any well used elsewhere.
每个外来者在他们眼里都是靶子,随时可能受到攻击。但我必须说,在任何其他国家都看不到的是,在那里很少看到外人受到伤害,就如在其他地方很少看到外人受到好待遇一样罕见。

Yet presume not too much of the courtesies of those, for they differ in natures, some are hot, some cold, one simple, another wily; yet if thou use few words and fair speeches, thou shalt command anything thou stand in need of.
但也不要过于依赖他们的礼节,因为他们各有不同的个性,有热情的,也有冷淡的,或者单纯,或者狡黠。不过,只要你言辞恳挚简练,就能获得所需的一切。
