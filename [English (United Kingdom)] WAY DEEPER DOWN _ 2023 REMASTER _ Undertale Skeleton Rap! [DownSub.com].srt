00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,023
More info in the description below

7
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,500
Now, back to the skeletons

8
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:36,868
So, I said, 'Patella? I barely know her!’

9
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:39,222
Sans! Stop your tomfoolery!

10
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:40,940
We are here to stand guard!

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,104
Wait here and keep your eyes out for humans!

12
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:47,462
Eyes out? My eyes came out years ago!

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,631
Well, what do we got here?

14
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,209
They call me Sans, I'm the serif of these parts

15
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:01,576
Nah, just kiddin', I work on a grease cart

16
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:04,178
Grillin’ up hot dogs and genocidal toddlers

17
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:06,526
You can run, but I'll know if you restart

18
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,932
If you want a bad time, Then you're in the right place

19
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:11,378
Just look into my eye, see my funny type-face

20
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:13,933
I'm really quite a nice guy but if you pick a fight

21
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,284
I will hunt you all your life through time and space

22
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,823
Can you blame me if I feel a little hubris?

23
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:21,230
For my fame for making things a little humerus?

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,902
I can tickle your bones to the tibia toes

25
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:26,112
Well, unless you're my bro, jokes flow over his head

26
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:28,542
Sans, who's there?  You ridiculous scamp!

27
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,737
No one! It's just an inconspicuous lamp

28
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:33,448
If you ever meet a skeleton In towels and some Wellingtons

29
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:35,972
Just humour him and let him win And think that he's a champ

30
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,347
I bet you think you've never met a skeleton? Well, I bet you've Mettaton

31
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,878
They just had a bunch of Gooey melanin and flesh upon

32
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:43,362
But never one was In the upper echelon of clever puns

33
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:45,987
I'll make you laugh or cry Depending on the run you've set upon

34
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:50,561
We're spooky, scary Sending shivers down your spine

35
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:54,925
You best prepare For a hilariously bad time

36
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:59,488
Every human one day Ends up six feet underground

37
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:05,097
But you're heading for a grave That's buried way, way deeper down

38
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:07,566
Nyagh! A human! Call the guards!

39
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:09,863
Wait a minute, that's my job

40
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,167
To capture and nab you won't be hard

41
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:15,285
This maze is made with electric charge!

42
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,332
Wait, how did you get this far?

43
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:19,667
It took three weeks to erect this part

44
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:22,214
I genuinely didn't expect this, darn

45
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:24,675
How did you correctly guess this path?

46
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:26,714
I am Papyrus! Traps set, armed and ready

47
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:29,230
There's medals on my armour already Oh, plus some spaghetti

48
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,902
You're nervous! But, oh, that is good spaghetti

49
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,576
Where was I? I keep on forgetting

50
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:36,889
I am Papyrus! Best chef in the king's brigade

51
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,271
With the culinary skills To leave you flambéed

52
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,740
It's a shame that after You taste my blade

53
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,406
You won't have space For my bolognese

54
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:46,820
So, I guess you could say That they pasta-way?

55
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,070
Sans! Is this how you have to behave?

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,327
I'm trying to challenge This dastardly knave!

57
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,960
Now I've run out of bars And they just ran away!

58
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,007
We're spooky, scary Sending shivers down your spine

59
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:03,756
I serve spaghetti And incredibly good rhymes!

60
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:07,991
Every human one day Ends up six feet underground

61
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:13,499
But you're heading for a grave That's buried way, way deeper down

62
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:18,488
So, you took a little fall? Do you think you've got the gall To survive extermination?

63
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:23,605
Trapped deep below And all you've got to show Is your determination

64
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:27,730
There's no tu-Toriel It's Asgore-y as can be

65
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,082
Will the weight of your sins Leave you Snowdin?

66
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:33,574
There's no mercy

67
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:36,035
Who dares disturb me From my slumber?

68
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:38,082
Stick around This'll be a fun number

69
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:40,585
I'm truly versed in tearing All the universe asunder

70
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:42,851
I also have a specialty In unlucky spelunkers

71
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,116
I'm a puzzle in a bubble In the stuff of your dreams

72
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:47,366
Rupture realities and guzzle On the stuff in between

73
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,077
You'll be befuddled when I muscle in And muddle the scenes

74
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:52,616
Hit the shuffle and I'll tunnel Through the fuzz on your screen

75
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:55,499
You're in trouble, you see If you try and tussle with the W.D.

76
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,890
You'll take a tumble Then you'll crumble into rubble, debris

77
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,351
I bring the muscle to the scuffle Plus a couple of beams

78
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,859
But my blasters won't be loud enough To muffle your screams

79
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,999
When you're caught in the cycle Of an undying skeleton

80
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,499
Might as well strive to be Front of the peloton

81
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,773
Top of my field But out of my elements

82
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:12,437
Testing your death Would be a welcome experiment

83
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,913
I reign eternal So be certain that I'm well-rehearsed

84
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:17,632
Rhymes so very fine That every line feels like a multi-verse

85
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,046
Every parallel dimension Is at my command

86
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:22,484
But when it comes to spitting fire I've the matter in hands

87
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:26,999
We're spooky, scary Sending shivers down your spine

88
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:31,585
I'm outside of time and space But I'm afraid you're just out of time!

89
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:36,312
Every human one day Ends up six feet underground

90
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:41,679
But you're heading for a grave That's buried way, way deeper down

91
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:45,523
Nyagh! I'll get them next time, Sans! You hear me I will!

92
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:47,679
Way, way deeper down

93
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,163
Let me guess, You can feel it in your bones?

94
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:52,499
Way, way deeper down

95
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:57,998
Eugh, I'm going! Listening to the two of you bicker Is making my skin crawl...

96
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,077
Metaphorically

97
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:01,881
Way, way deeper down

98
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:05,716
